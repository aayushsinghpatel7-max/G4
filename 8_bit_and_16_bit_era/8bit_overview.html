    <title>The 8-Bit Era – The Birth of Modern Gaming </title>

    <h1>What does 8-bit mean</h1>
    <p>
        Video games can be defined in many ways. We can categorize them by genre, year, system, or country of origin. Some of these terms may become less useful over time, yet they still play an important role in gaming’s legacy and cultural impact. One such term is 8-bit, a classic designation that continues to serve as an important descriptor decades after its inception. But what exactly does 8-bit mean, and how is the term used today?
    </p>

    <h2>The Origins of 8-Bit in Gaming</h2>
    <p>
        Technically, the term “8-bit” refers to a computing system with a data width of eight bits. This data width determines how much information the system can access in a single instruction. The more bits a system can process at once, the more complex the instructions and results can be. In the context of video games, “bits” are often used to refer to early game consoles and generations. The 8-bit label applies to platforms like the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the Sega Master System, and the Atari 7800.

    <h2>8-Bit Titles</h2>
    <p>
        The 8-bit designation also describes the games produced for these systems. Classic titles such as Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Mega Man, Castlevania, and Final Fantasy are all considered 8-bit games.

    <h2>Audio and Visual Style</h2>
    <p>
        8-bit isn’t just about hardware limitations—it also refers to the distinctive audio and visual style these games produced. Large pixel sprites of limited detail, along with music made of simple blips and low fidelity, are hallmarks of 8-bit gaming. This aesthetic continues to be celebrated and influences modern games even today.
