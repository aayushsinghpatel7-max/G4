                        The evolution of video game graphics has been a remarkable journey. What began as simple shapes made from a handful of pixels has grown into vibrant, dynamic worlds filled with detail and motion. Before modern consoles and high-resolution displays, the early generations of gaming systems helped establish the visual styles and design techniques that shaped the industry. Among the most important milestones in this history were the 8-bit and 16-bit eras—two periods that pushed technology forward and captured the imagination of players around the world.
                        The 8-Bit Era (Late 1970s – Early 1980s)
                        The 8-bit era introduced video games into mainstream entertainment. Graphics during this time were built from pixels, tiny squares of color arranged on the screen to form characters, environments, and visual effects. Because early gaming hardware had extremely limited processing power, developers could only use a small number of colors and simple shapes. Despite these restrictions, the creativity of game designers flourished.
                        Developers relied on clear silhouettes and recognizable patterns to make their characters memorable. This is why 8-bit visuals are bold, iconic, and instantly recognizable even today. Games from this era often had charming simplicity, but they laid the groundwork for nearly every genre we now take for granted.
                        Iconic 8-bit games include:
                    </p>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pac-Man – famous for its simple maze design and instantly memorable character.</li>
                            <li>Space Invaders – a foundational shooter that defined early arcade gameplay.</li>
                            <li>Donkey Kong – introduced platforming elements and the character who would become Mario.</li>
                            <li>Super Mario Bros. – a milestone in side-scrolling action and level design.</li>
                            <li>Shovel Knight (a modern game made in the style of 8-bit art).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">

                    <p>
                        The 8-bit era proved that games could be fun, expressive, and full of personality—even with very limited technology.
                        The 16-Bit Era (Late 1980s – Early 1990s)
                        As technology progressed, game consoles became capable of handling 16-bit processing, which allowed for more complex graphics, more colors on screen, and better animation. Characters became more detailed, environments became more vibrant, and developers had the ability to create worlds with stronger moods and identities.
                        One of the most important advancements in this era was parallax scrolling, where background layers moved at different speeds to create a sense of depth. This technique made games feel richer and more immersive, giving backgrounds a layered, almost 3D-like appearance. Sprite animation also improved, resulting in smoother character movements and more dynamic action on screen.
                        Notable 16-bit games include:
                    </p>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sonic the Hedgehog – known for its fast gameplay and vibrant world design.</li>
                            <li>Super Mario World – expanded platforming gameplay and introduced lush backgrounds.</li>
                            <li>OutRun – showcased detailed environments with stylish visual flair.</li>
                            <li>Space Harrier – demonstrated fast, arcade-style pseudo-3D movement.</li>
                            <li>Star Wars (16-bit editions) – showed how franchises could adapt to enhanced graphics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

                        The 16-bit era represented a major leap forward in both artistic expression and technical ability. Many beloved gaming franchises reached new creative heights during this time, and the visual styles developed in this era continue to influence modern pixel art.
                        A Transition Toward 3D
                        By the mid-1990s, game developers began experimenting with 3D environments, leading to consoles like the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64. The shift to 3D graphics opened the door to entirely new gameplay concepts and visual styles. However, the artistic legacy of 8-bit and 16-bit games remains strong. Their charm, creativity, and iconic aesthetics continue to inspire both developers and players, especially in the rise of modern indie and retro-style games.
