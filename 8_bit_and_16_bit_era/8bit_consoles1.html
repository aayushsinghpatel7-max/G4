    <title>Legendary 8-Bit Consoles – Nintendo Entertainment System</title>

<body>
    <h2>The 8-Bit Era and NES Origins</h2>
    <p>
        The 8-bit era, also known as the Third Generation of video game consoles, began after the Video Game Crash of 1983, when the U.S. market lost confidence due to low-quality releases and lack of regulation. Nintendo, already successful with arcade hits like Donkey Kong, entered the home gaming market in Japan with the Famicom in 1983.
        After a failed distribution deal with Atari, Nintendo brought the console to North America. To overcome skepticism toward video games and Japanese products, Nintendo redesigned the system to resemble a VCR and marketed it as a toy using the accessory R.O.B. The console was ultimately released as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985–86.

    <h2>NES Success and Popular Games</h2>
    <p>
        The NES became hugely successful thanks to Super Mario Bros., which introduced smooth scrolling and set the standard for platformers. Nintendo shaped new genres with titles like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, alongside influential third-party releases such as Konami’s Castlevania and Gradius.
        The NES revived the North American video game industry after the crash and set standards that shaped modern gaming, including the directional control pad and the third-party licensing system. Accessories like the Zapper and R.O.B., combined with strict quality control, helped regain public trust.

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        The NES launched long-running franchises such as Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Mega Man, shaping the future of the industry. While it struggled in some European markets, it remained popular in Japan and North America. Its legacy continues today, inspiring the NES Classic Edition in 2016 and influencing modern game design.
