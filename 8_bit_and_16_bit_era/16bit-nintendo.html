    <h1>Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)</h1>
    <p>
        The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), released by Nintendo in 1990 in Japan (as the Super Famicom) and 1991 in North America, 
        is one of the most iconic and influential consoles of the 16-bit era. It featured a 16-bit Ricoh 5A22 processor, capable of advanced graphical 
        and audio operations that far surpassed the company's earlier 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The SNES supported a wide color 
        palette of over 32,000 colors, multiple scrolling background layers, and visual effects such as rotation, scaling, and pseudo-3D rendering 
        through its famous “Mode 7” feature.

        Equally remarkable was its sound system, powered by the Sony SPC700 chip, which allowed high-quality sample-based audio and sophisticated 
        sound mixing. This gave composers and sound designers the ability to craft rich, orchestral soundtracks and immersive ambient effects that 
        were groundbreaking for the time.

        The SNES library included many landmark titles — <em>Super Mario World</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, 
        <em>Super Metroid</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> — each demonstrating the system's creative and technical potential. 
        Its combination of advanced hardware and timeless design made the SNES a defining force in shaping modern gaming aesthetics and storytelling.
