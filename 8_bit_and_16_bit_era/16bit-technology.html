        <h2>16-bit Graphic Evolution</h2>
        <p>
            The leap in 16-bit visuals came largely from dedicated graphics hardware rather than raw CPU power. 
            On the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), two coordinated PPUs (PPU1 and PPU2) fetched visual data from a 64 KB VRAM composed of two 8-bit, 32 KB RAM chips. 
            This memory stored tile sets (8x8 pixel graphic units), tile maps (defining where tiles appear), sprite attributes (OAM), and color information (CGRAM). 
            With multiple background layers (BG1-BG3) and a separate sprite layer, the SNES could scroll each layer independently for parallax depth, apply priority and blending effects, 
            and display up to 256 on-screen colors selected from a palette of 32,768. 
            This hardware pipeline allowed artists to build expansive scenes from compact tiles and animate characters as separate sprites without redrawing entire frames. 
            Features like the SNES's Mode 7 enabled real-time rotation, scaling, and pseudo-3D transformations, delivering cinematic camera movement and dynamic world effects never before seen in 2D games.
        </p>
        <p>
            These advancements fundamentally reshaped visual storytelling. Games no longer relied solely on symbolic or abstract imagery;
            instead, they could convey mood, atmosphere, and a sense of realism through richer shading, smoother animation, and more convincing perspective.
            Developers combined layered environments, gentle color gradients, and intricate sprite motion to make gameplay worlds more immersive, expressive,
            and emotionally nuanced — pushing the boundaries of what 2D art could achieve.

        <h2>Sound Evolution</h2>
        <p>
            Alongside the advancements in graphics, the 16-bit era brought a revolution in sound design, with audio hardware enabling simulated surround effects for the first time in home gaming. 
            Systems like the SNES incorporated advanced sound subsystems capable of independently processing eight audio channels with precise control over panning, echo, filtering, and phase. 
            A key example is the Sony SPC700-based S-SMP audio subsystem, which combined an 8-bit SPC700 CPU, a 16-bit digital signal processor (DSP) for mixing sampled audio, and 64 KB of dedicated PSRAM. 
            Operating completely independently from the main system and clocked at 24.576 MHz on both NTSC and PAL units, the subsystem produced stereo output using eight voices built from BRR-compressed 16-bit audio samples and supported real-time effects such as echo and pitch modulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            By deliberately shifting phase relationships and distributing audio cues across stereo channels, developers could encode soundtracks in a format compatible with Dolby Pro Logic and other surround-decoding technologies. 
            When played through external stereo equipment equipped with these decoders, the signal was expanded into rear-channel audio, creating the illusion of directional or ambient sound behind the player. 
            This ability to deliver pseudo-surround sound marked a significant advancement over the monaural and limited stereo output of earlier 8-bit consoles.
