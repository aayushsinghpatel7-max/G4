    <h2>16-bit Graphic Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        The 16-bit generation marked a dramatic leap in visual fidelity, introducing richer color palettes, 
        larger sprites, and multi-layered backgrounds that allowed for parallax scrolling and depth effects. 
        Consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Genesis could display 
        thousands of colors simultaneously, enabling artists to create smoother gradients and more detailed character designs. 
        Hardware features like SNES's Mode 7 allowed rotation, scaling, and pseudo-3D transformations, 
        bringing cinematic perspectives and dynamic world movement to 2D games for the first time.

        These advancements transformed visual storytelling. Games no longer relied solely on symbolic imagery; 
        they could now express mood, atmosphere, and realism through shading, animation, and perspective. 
        Developers used layered environments, soft color transitions, and complex sprite animations to make 
        gameplay more immersive and expressive — effectively pushing the limits of 2D art.

    <h2>Sound Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        Alongside graphics, the 16-bit era revolutionized sound design. Dedicated audio chips like the Sony SPC700 
        in the SNES and the Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesizer in the Genesis introduced multi-channel sound mixing, 
        sample playback, and advanced synthesis. This allowed composers to create rich, orchestral arrangements 
        and realistic sound effects that were impossible on earlier 8-bit systems. Music could now carry emotional tone 
        and cinematic presence, transforming the listening experience into a key storytelling element.

    <p>
        The combination of FM synthesis, PCM samples, and expanded memory made it possible to mix realistic instruments 
        with synthesized tones. Soundtracks became more atmospheric and varied — from the lush melodies of 
        <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> to the iconic bass-driven energy of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>. 
        The result was a generation of games whose audio identity was as distinct and memorable as their visuals, 
        cementing the 16-bit era as a golden age of expressive game design.
