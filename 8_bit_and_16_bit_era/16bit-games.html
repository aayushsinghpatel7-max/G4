    <h1>Sonic the Hedgehog (1991)</h1>
    <p>
        Released for the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> became one of the defining titles of the 16-bit era. 
        It combined ultra-fast platforming, bold sprite graphics, and memorable FM-synth soundtracks to establish Sega as a true rival to Nintendo. 
        The game's emphasis on velocity, momentum, and loop-based stage design created a brand-new sense of dynamism and attitude in platform games.

    <h2>Why it mattered in the 16-bit era:</h2>
    <p>
        Sonic showcased what the 16-bit Genesis hardware could do — smooth scrolling at high speed, large colorful sprites, and multilayered parallax backgrounds. 
        Its technical sophistication was inseparable from its identity: the hardware's faster processor allowed gameplay that would have been impossible on 8-bit consoles. 
        Sonic thus became both a mascot and a demonstration of 16-bit power, symbolizing the jump from simple arcade precision to fluid, character-driven design.

    <h1>Super Metroid (1994)</h1>
    <p>
        Developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), <em>Super Metroid</em> is celebrated as one of the greatest 16-bit masterpieces. 
        It offered a moody, cinematic atmosphere and a vast interconnected world that invited players to explore freely. 
        Its combination of responsive controls, layered sound design, and pixel-art environments set new standards for immersion and storytelling through gameplay.
    </p>
    <h2>Why it mattered in the 16-bit era:</h2>
    <p>
        The SNES hardware enabled <em>Super Metroid</em> to use richer color palettes, deeper shadows, and reverb-enhanced audio that shaped the game's isolationist tone. 
        The cartridge's expanded memory allowed seamless world transitions and detailed sprite animations. 
        The result was a game that turned technical capacity into emotional depth — a hallmark of the 16-bit generation's ambition to move beyond “gameplay loops” toward world-building and atmosphere.

    <h1>Final Fantasy VI (1994)</h1>
    <p>
        Square's <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> represented the narrative and artistic zenith of the 16-bit role-playing genre. 
        Featuring an ensemble cast, sweeping orchestral compositions (via the SNES's sample-based audio), and cinematic storytelling, it pushed the limits of what players expected from RPGs. 
        Each location, sprite animation, and melody was crafted with remarkable attention to detail.
    </p>
    <h2>Why it mattered in the 16-bit era:</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> proved that 16-bit systems could deliver emotionally complex stories on par with other narrative media. 
        Using the SNES's Mode 7 visual effects and sophisticated sample playback, it created scenes that felt epic in scope despite hardware limits. 
        The game bridged technical prowess and emotional storytelling — demonstrating how the 16-bit generation transformed video games from mechanical challenges into artistic experiences.
