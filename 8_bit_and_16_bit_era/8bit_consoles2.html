                    <h2>The 8-Bit Era and Competing Consoles</h2>
                    <P>
                        As the 8-bit era progressed, Sega sought to challenge Nintendo’s dominance with the Master System, which was technically more powerful but struggled against Nintendo's strict licensing control in Japan and North America. Despite this, the system found success in regions such as Europe, Oceania, and especially Brazil.

                    <h2>Sega Master System</h2>

                    <p>
                        Released internationally in 1986, the Master System was based on the Sega Mark III and featured enhanced graphics, a faster CPU, and support for both cartridges and MyCard game cards. A Japanese re-release in 1987 added improved FM sound capabilities.
                        Despite its technical advantages, the Master System struggled in Japan and North America due to Nintendo’s exclusive third-party contracts and competition from NEC’s PC Engine. However, it became very successful in Europe and Brazil, where Sega partnered with Tectoy to manufacture and market the console locally. In Brazil, it remained popular for over a decade, with production continuing into the early 2000s.
                        The Master System also helped launch important Sega franchises, including Phantasy Star, and its hardware later influenced Sega’s Game Gear handheld system.

                        Atari attempted to re-enter the home console market with the 7800, but internal company issues limited its success. It never regained the influence Atari once had and was overshadowed by the NES and Sega Master System.

                    <h2>Advances in the 8-Bit Era</h2>
                    <p>
                        This era saw major growth in game design: side-scrolling worlds replaced single-screen gameplay, graphics became more colorful and detailed, and games shifted from endless score loops to structured adventures with endings. Developers also began including more story directly in the game, rather than relying solely on manuals.
                        Many iconic franchises, including Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Mega Man, were launched during this time, cementing the 8-bit era’s legacy in gaming history.
