      In the seventies, the world of video games was still in its early days. In fact, following
      the first experiments with the <em>Magnavox Odyssey</em>, new protagonists begin to enter the market, 
      bringing ideas and technologies destined to revolutionize electronic entertainment. Among 
the first and most important competitors stood out <strong>Atari</strong>, with the iconic Pong game, 
      and Fairchild, with the revolutionary <strong>Fairchild Channel F,</strong>, the first console to use 
      interchangeable cartridges.

       <h2>Atari Pong Consoles</h2>

        <h3>Release</h3>

        <p>
          In <strong>June 1972</strong> Atari released <em>Pong</em>, the first video game to 
          achieve large-scale success. This happens mainly thanks to simplicity and accessibility, 
          in fact Pong is often described as a social phenomenon, because the game quickly spread 
          among bars, arcades and public places, involving children, adults, families, in a nutshell, 
          people of all ages. 
        </p>

        <p>
          However, in the first years it was only distributed in an arcade version, in fact only 
          in 1975, three years after the realease, it started to enter homes for the first time, 
          since before then televisions were not yet compatible with game technology. More precisely, 
          it occurred on <strong>August 3, 1975</strong>, when Atari, in collaboration with the 
          <em>Sears</em> chain, launched a <strong>home console</strong>, which could be connected 
          to the television. Thanks to this new format, production costs were greatly reduced and 
          the video game became accessible to an even larger audience. Since the arcade version already 
          had enormous popularity, as soon as the console was released the success was immediate, Pong 
          in fact became the most desired gift of Christmas 1975 in the United States, reaching over 
          <strong>150,000 units sold</strong>, something that had never happened before, at the time.  
        </p>
      

        <h3>Console</h3>
        <p>
          The Pong's home console was a fairly simple device overall, but the turning point was the 
          ingenuity with which it was designed. In fact, it had a solid and squared body, with the 
          particularity of having two knobs (called paddles) that allowed players to move their racket. 
          The game, conceived and developed by electronics engineer <strong>Allan “Al” Alcorn</strong> 
          based on a design by <strong>Nolan Bushnell</strong>, as mentioned previously, represented a 
          home version of the original arcade. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The machine used an <strong>Atari LSI (Large Scale Integration)</strong> chip, 
          a compact version of the arcade version, which allowed it to contain costs and make 
          the product suitable for the domestic market. 
        </p>


        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Pong, as can be deduced from the name, has often been defined as "<strong>the electronic version
          of table tennis</strong>". In fact, on the black and white screen, appear two vertical bars, that 
          are the rackets, and a ball that bounces between them. Each time a player fails to respond, so it 
          fails to hit the ball with their "<strong>racket</strong>", the other earns a point. The 
          <strong>score</strong>, shown on the screen, makes the challenge even more competitive. The game, 
          developed by Alcorn under the supervision of Bushnell and Ted Dabney, was inspired by <em>Table Tennis</em>, 
          one of the games featured on the <em>Magnavox Odyssey</em>.
        </p>


        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Pong's success led to the birth of a real family of home consoles, such as <em>Super Pong, Ultra Pong</em>
          and many others. The diffusion of equivalent chips, started a spread of clones, thousands of official and 
          non-official versions, produced by companies around the world, including <em>Coleco</em>, <em>Nintendo</em> 
          and even the italian <em>Zanussi</em>. Pong represented a turning point for the entire gaming industry. 
          The idea of bringing a video game into homes forever transformed the way of understanding entertainment. 
          It not only paved the way for home consoles, but also demonstrated that video games could be a social and 
          family experience. Today, more than five decades after its release, Pong remains one of pop culture's most 
          recognizable icons and a symbol of the technological innovation.

        <h2>Fairchild Channel F</h2>


        <h3>Release</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Fairchild Channel F</strong> (also called <em>Channel Fun</em>) was produced by 
          <em>Fairchild Semiconductor</em>, and launched in <strong>August 1976</strong> at a price of $169.95. 
          Its most important feature is that it was the first home console to use <strong>interchangeable cartridges
          </strong>, thus giving rise for the second generation of consoles. Developed by engineer <strong>Jerry 
          Lawson</strong>, the system represented a revolutionary step, in fact for the first time the game code 
          was not fixed in the console, but contained in programmable ROM “plug-in” cartridges. This innovation 
          made it possible to create and distribute new titles without producing a new console.
        </p>


        <h3>Console</h3>
        <p>
          The Channel F introduced many new features for the time, such as a <strong>pause button</strong> that allowed 
          you to stop the game and change settings such as time and speed, without losing the score. They also made 
          the <strong>controllers detachable</strong>, and with a futuristic design for the time, i.e. handy cylindrical 
          joysticks capable of rotating like paddles and moving in eight directions. Even if the system had not a 
          commercial success, these technical solutions influenced subsequent consoles.
        </p>


        <h3>Games</h3>
        <p>
          The console came with two titles pre-installed, but during its time on the market, <strong>27</strong> 
          official cartridges, costing approximately $20 each, called <strong>Videocarts</strong>, were released. 
          Each of which contained one or more games, including for example Tennis and Hockey, and also advanced 
          variants of classic <em>Pong</em>. In addition, some experimental versions involved the use of additional
          accessories such as keyboards, but these designs were abandoned with the license being switched.
        </p>


        <h3>Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Despite numerous innovations, the <em>Channel F</em> was quickly overtaken by the <em>Atari VCS</em>
          (known as the <em>Atari 2600</em>), which took over the market due to a richer catalog and increased 
          power. In 1979 ,<em>Fairchild</em> sold the brand to <em>Zircon International</em>, which retained 
          the rights until 1983. Although not having had a great commercial impact, the console remains an 
          unalandmark in the history of video games for having introduced the concept of a programmable 
          cartridge console.
