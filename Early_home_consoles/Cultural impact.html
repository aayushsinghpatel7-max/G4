      <h2>Video Games Enter the Home</h2>
      <p>
        Before the 1970s, video games were limited to laboratories and arcades.  
        When consoles like the <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong> and <strong>Atari 2600</strong> reached homes, 
        they transformed entertainment itself.  
        Playing together in the living room became a new kind of social activity, mixing 
        <em>family interaction</em> with cutting-edge technology.

        Characters like <em>Pac-Man</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> became household icons, inspiring toys, cereal boxes, and even pop songs.

      <h2>Media Panic and Moral Debate</h2>
      <p>
        As gaming became mainstream, critics raised concerns about its influence on children and society.  
        News outlets questioned whether screen time, flashing lights, and “addictive gameplay” could have negative effects.  
        These early debates foreshadowed ongoing discussions about <strong>violence, addiction, and youth behavior</strong> in media.

      <aside class="note">
        Despite moral worries, studies from the era often highlighted the <em>cognitive benefits</em> of hand-eye coordination and pattern recognition developed through play.

      <h2>Economic and Technological Ripple</h2>
      <p>
        The popularity of consoles drove rapid innovation in <strong>television technology</strong> and consumer electronics.  
        Demand for color displays, better sound, and cheaper chips accelerated the tech industry.  
        Home gaming also created thousands of jobs, from programmers to toy marketers, 
        establishing <em>video games as a serious economic force</em>.

      <h2>Legacy: A Permanent Shift in Culture</h2>
      <p>
        By 1983, even as the market faced its first crash, gaming had left a lasting imprint.  
        It taught people to interact with technology in playful, personal ways, paving the road for the next generation of consoles and digital entertainment.  
        The early home console era didn’t just invent an industry, it <em>redefined what it meant to have fun at home</em>.
