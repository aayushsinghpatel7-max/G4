<h3>By 1983, the North American video game market collapsed almost entirely due to a combination of oversaturation, loss of quality control, and growing competition from home computers. What had been a booming industry suddenly entered a severe crash, with sales dropping by nearly 97% in a single year.

<h2><div class="glitch">Main causes of the crash:</div></h2> 
</div>
<div class= "content ul">
<ul>
<li><h3>Too many consoles and no clear standard</h3> 
</li>
<p>MULTIPLE SYSTEMS COMPETED AT THE SAME TIME, OFTEN WITH INCOMPATIBLE TECHNOLOGY AND EXCLUSIVE GAMES. CONSUMERS BECAME CONFUSED AND HESITANT TO INVEST. 
</p>
<li><h3>Explosion of low-quality games from uncontrolled third-party publishers</h3> 
</li>
<p>AFTER COMPANIES LIKE ACTIVISION PROVED THAT THIRD-PARTY PUBLISHING COULD BE PROFITABLE, MANY INEXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS RUSHED IN BY RELEASING QUICK, POORLY MADE GAMES WITH ALMOST NO QUALITY TESTING.
</p>
<li><h3>Retailers lost confidence</h3> 
</li>
<p>UNSOLD GAMES AND CONSOLES PILED UP IN STORES, FORCING RETAILERS TO HEAVILY DISCOUNT HARDWARE AND EVENTUALLY REMOVE VIDEO GAMES FROM SHELVES TO MAKE ROOM FOR PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY SOLD.</p>
<li><h3>Rising popularity of home computers</h3> 
</li>
<p>SYSTEMS LIKE THE COMMODORE 64 OFFERED MORE ADVANCED GRAPHICS AND THE ABILITY TO RUN EDUCATIONAL OR PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE, WHICH CONVINCED MANY FAMILIES TO BUY A COMPUTER INSTEAD OF A CONSOLE.</p>
</ul> 
</div>

<h3>The crash forced many gaming companies into bankruptcy and led analysts to believe that the home console industry might be permanently dead. However, this period of collapse would soon make way for a major shift and the entrance of a new dominant player called Nintendo <!--Want to add link to the nintendo part(not our group)-->>.
