    <h2>The Dawn of Home Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      Between <strong>1972 and 1983</strong>, video games evolved from experimental curiosities into a true home entertainment revolution.  
      The <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong>, the first home console, allowed families
      to interact with their TVs in ways never imagined before.
      From that moment on, the idea of “playing at home” was born.

    <h2>From Circuits to Cartridges</h2>
    <p>
      Early consoles were incredibly simple: they ran games built directly into the hardware,
      often with minimal graphics and sound.  
      But soon, innovators like <strong>Fairchild</strong> and <strong>Atari</strong> began to push the limits.
      The <em>Fairchild Channel F</em> introduced programmable cartridges, a concept that changed everything,
      allowing players to switch games without buying a new machine.

      <h2>Why This Era Matters</h2>
      <p>
        This decade laid the <em>foundation of modern gaming</em>.  
        Concepts like scorekeeping, controller input, interchangeable games, and television-based interaction were all pioneered during this period.  
        Even though the technology was limited, creativity thrived, giving birth to an art form that continues to evolve today.
