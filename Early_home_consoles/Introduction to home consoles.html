    <h2>From Experimentation to Industry</h2>
    <p>Early systems were extremely simple—most offered just a few variations of “ball and paddle” games.
      But by the late 1970s, companies like <strong>Atari</strong>, <strong>Fairchild</strong>, and <strong>Coleco</strong> pushed technology forward, creating programmable consoles with interchangeable cartridges and recognizable branding.
    </p>
    <p>
      These innovations laid the foundation for the modern video game industry, introducing key ideas such as player identity, high scores, and home entertainment systems as central to family life.

    <h2>Why This Era Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The period from 1972 to 1983 represents the <em>birth and first rise</em> of video gaming. 
      It was a decade of creativity, experimentation, and bold ideas that turned a niche curiosity into a cultural force.
      Even though the industry faced a massive crash in 1983, the legacy of this era set the stage for the golden age of gaming that followed in the late 1980s.
