    <h2>The Rise of Competition</h2>
    <p>
      After the success of the <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong> and Atari’s <em>Pong</em>, dozens of companies rushed to enter the growing home console market.
      Among the most notable early competitors were <strong>Coleco</strong> and <strong>Sears</strong>, both of whom aimed to bring gaming to a wider audience with affordable, accessible systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Coleco Telstar: The pong clone mania</h2>
    <p>
      Released in <strong>1976</strong>, the <strong>Coleco Telstar</strong> was designed as an affordable alternative to Atari’s home Pong. It featured a simple design with two paddle controllers and offered multiple built-in Pong variants including tennis, hockey, and handball.
      Powered by the <em>General Instrument AY-3-8500</em> chip, the Telstar became a commercial success, leading Coleco to produce over a dozen variants in just a few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each new version introduced small improvements: color output, gun controllers,
      and different game combinations. However, the oversaturation of the market would
      later contribute to the industry’s instability at the end of the decade.

    <h2>Sears Tele-Games: The Branded Approach</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sears</strong>, the American retail giant, entered the gaming scene by rebranding and selling <strong>Atari’s Pong console</strong> under its own name: <em>Sears Tele-Games</em>.
      This partnership gave Atari access to Sears’ huge distribution network, reaching households that might never have bought directly from a specialized electronics brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sears also sold exclusive versions of later Atari consoles, including the <em>Sears Video Arcade</em>, a rebranded <strong>Atari 2600</strong>.
      This collaboration played a key role in spreading home gaming to mainstream consumers, transforming it from a niche hobby into a cultural trend.

      <h2>Why They Mattered</h2>
      <p>
        The early rivalry between Coleco and Sears illustrated how quickly the home console market evolved.
        These companies not only fueled public interest but also laid the groundwork for future giants like Atari, Nintendo, and Sega.  
        Their experimentation, both in design and marketing, shaped the business strategies that would define the gaming industry for decades.
