    <p>
      Between <strong>1972 and 1983</strong>, home consoles achieved such popularity that 
      they went from being a risk to an important global industry. Until overnight it all 
      collapsed, and reshaped the way games were designed, sold and even perceived by society.

    <h2>The Economic Expansion (1977–1982)</h2>

    <p>
      Like we saw in the <a href="Competitors Rise.html" class="btn-neon">"Competitors Rise"</a>, 
      the end of the 70s brought an explosion of new consoles and arcades. Companies like 
      <em>Atari</em>, <em>Mattel</em>, and <em>Coleco</em> made millions selling consoles 
      and cartridges. In fact, f a few years, video games were the <strong>most popular product 
      in technology sector</strong>.

    <h2>The 1983 Video Game Crash</h2>

    <p>
      In 1983, came the collapse mentioned above, sales fell nearly 97% in North America.  
      Companies like <em>Atari</em>, <em>Mattel</em>, and <em>Coleco</em> have lost 
      millions. The warehouses were full of unsold cartridges and many were 
      literally <strong>buried in the New Mexico desert by Atari</strong>.

    <aside class="warning">
      The <strong>collapse of 1983</strong> brushed away most American console manufacturers.  
      In fact, investors called video games a passing trend and the industry risked 
      disappearing forever.

      transformed the identity of gaming:

    <!-- Section 4 (Impact) -->
    <h2>The Impact of the First Generation</h2>

    <p>
      The crash of 1983 paved the way for new ideas. In the same year, in Japan, <em>Nintendo</em> 
      launched <em>Family Computer (Famicom)</em>, which was renamed <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</strong>, 
      as we know it today. With stricter quality control and a focus on gameplay, NES saved
      and relaunched the entire industry in the following years.
