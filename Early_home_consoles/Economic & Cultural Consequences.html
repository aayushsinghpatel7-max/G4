    <p>
      Between <strong>1972 and 1983</strong>, home consoles achieved such popularity that 
      they went from being a risk to an important global industry. Until overnight it all 
      collapsed, and reshaped the way games were designed, sold and even perceived by society.
    </p>

    <h2>The Economic Expansion (1977–1982)</h2>

    <p>
      Like we saw in the "Competitors Rise" section, 
      the end of the 70s brought an explosion of new consoles and arcades. Companies like 
      <em>Atari</em>, <em>Mattel</em>, and <em>Coleco</em> made millions selling consoles 
      and cartridges. In fact, f a few years, video games were the <strong>most popular product 
      in technology sector</strong>.
    </p>

      <img src="images/Eco&Cultural-consequences_Playing-home.jpg.webp" class="picture rounded border-neon inline"/>
      <img src="images/Eco&Cultural-consequences_Atari-ads.jpg" class="picture rounded border-neon inline"/>
    </div>

    <br>

    <ul>
      <li>In 1982, video game revenues in the United States were estimated at $3.2 billion</li>
      <li>Thanks to consoles, cartridges have become a recurring source of income for companies</li>
      <li>Marketing focused on <strong>family fun</strong> and <strong>arcade at home</strong> experiences</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="note">
      After years, for the first time, video games were finally seen as a source of 
      entertainment, not just a technological curiosity.
    </aside>

    <br><hr><br> 



    <h2>The 1983 Video Game Crash</h2>

    <p>
      In 1983, came the collapse mentioned above, sales fell nearly 97% in North America.  
      Companies like <em>Atari</em>, <em>Mattel</em>, and <em>Coleco</em> have lost 
      millions. The warehouses were full of unsold cartridges and many were 
      literally <strong>buried in the New Mexico desert by Atari</strong>.
    </p>

    <aside class="note">
      The <strong>collapse of 1983</strong> brushed away most American console manufacturers.  
      In fact, investors called video games a passing trend and the industry risked 
      disappearing forever.

    <h2>Cultural Consequences</h2>

    <p>
      Despite the financial disaster, the "first era" left profound cultural marks that 
      transformed the identity of gaming:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Introduction of the <strong>video game as a domestic activity</strong>, families played together</li>
      <li>Creation of the first <strong>"fan culture"</strong> through magazines and TV ads</li>
      <li>It began early debates about screen time and the direction youth culture took</li>
      <li>Encouraged <strong>technical development</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <br>

      <img src="images/Eco&Cultural-consequences_play-video-games.jpg.webp" class="picture rounded border-neon inline"/>
    </div>

    <br>

    <aside class="note">
      These years have transformed video games into a form of pop culture, as if a bridge 
      had been created between technology, entertainment and art.
    </aside>

    <h2>The Impact of the First Generation</h2>

    <p>
      The crash of 1983 paved the way for new ideas. In the same year, in Japan, <em>Nintendo</em> 
      launched <em>Family Computer (Famicom)</em>, which was renamed <strong>Nintendo Entertainment 
      System (NES)</strong>, as we know it today. With stricter quality control and a focus on gameplay, 
      NES saved and relaunched the entire industry in the following years.
