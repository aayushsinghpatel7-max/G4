      <p>
        From 1977 to 1983, given the successes that reached consoles in the 1970s, 
        the home console market recorded an amizing growth. In fact, after <em>Magnavox 
        Odyssey</em> and <em>Fairchild Channel F</em>, new consoles started to enter homes 
        around the world, therefore outside the United States. These machines added 
        <strong>color graphics, sound, microprocessors, and interchangeable cartridges</strong>,
        transforming video games from a curiosity into a <strong>cultural phenomenon</strong>.

              The <strong>Atari 2600</strong> helped to rech the first importants peaks of success
              related to video-games. Its success is in fact largely due to the use of removable 
              cartridges and joystick controls, a huge novelty for the time, which allowed it to 
              offer hundreds of titles including <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Adventure</em>, and 
              <em>Pac-Man</em>.

              The <strong>Bally Astrocade</strong> (originally <em>Bally Professional Arcade</em>) 
              adressed at technology "fans", because it was equipped with programmable cartridges 
              and a built-in BASIC interpreter.

              Mattel’s <strong>Intellivision</strong> directly challenged Atari with considerable 
              improvement and a unique numeric keypad controller. Its slogan, <em>“Intelligent Television"</em>
              reflected its more strategic games and simulated sports.

              The <strong>Vectrex</strong> was the first home console who had its own monitor, displaying 
              vector-based graphics. This gave its games, like <em>Mine Storm</em> and <em>Scramble</em>, 
              a new and bright arcade look.

              The <strong>ColecoVision</strong> offered a quality close to arcade and was sold with

    <aside class="note">
      Between 1977 and 1983, over <strong>twenty home consoles</strong> were released.  
      The most successful established industry standards, like interchangeable cartridges, 
      dedicated processors, and big game libraries. Then independent studios such as 
      <em>Activision</em> and <em>Imagic</em> started creating games on their own, marking 
      a revolutionary step in the video game industry.

    <br>


    <h2>Global Expansion</h2>
    <p>
      The competition was not more limited olny to the United States. In fact, in Japan, companies 
      like <strong>Epoch</strong> launched the <em>Cassette Vision</em> (1981), while in Europe were 
      released systems like the <em>Interton VC 4000</em> and the <em>Philips Videopac G7000</em> 
      (also denominated the European Odyssey). Each region began to experiment with its own controllers, 
      cartridges, and marketing, all the companies wanted to achieve the perfect combination to create 
      the best console.

    <aside class="warning">
      In 1983 the market was booming, but dangerously saturated. In fact, the more consoles were 
      released, with hundreds of games and inconsistent quality, the closer an inevitable collapse was coming.
