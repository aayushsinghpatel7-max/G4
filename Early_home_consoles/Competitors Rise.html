    <p>
      From 1977 to 1983, given the successes that reached consoles in the 1970s, 
      the home console market recorded an amizing growth. In fact, after <em>Magnavox 
      Odyssey</em> and <em>Fairchild Channel F</em>, new consoles started to enter homes 
      around the world, therefore outside the United States. These machines added 
      <strong>color graphics, sound, microprocessors, and interchangeable cartridges</strong>,
      transforming video games from a curiosity into a <strong>cultural phenomenon</strong>.

            <p>
              The <strong>Atari 2600</strong> helped to rech the first importants peaks of success
              related to video-games. Its success is in fact largely due to the use of removable 
              cartridges and joystick controls, a huge novelty for the time, which allowed it to 
              offer hundreds of titles including <em>Space Invaders</em>, <em>Adventure</em>, and 
              <em>Pac-Man</em>.

              Mattel’s <strong>Intellivision</strong> directly challenged Atari with improved graphics and a unique numeric-pad controller. 
              Its slogan, “Intelligent Television,” reflected its more strategic gameplay and sports simulations.

              The <strong>Vectrex</strong> was the only home console with its own monitor, displaying vector-based graphics instead of raster pixels.
              This gave its games, like <em>Mine Storm</em> and <em>Scramble</em>, a sharp, glowing arcade look.

    <!-- Context & Third-Party Developers -->
    <aside class="note">
      Between 1977 and 1983, over <strong>twenty home consoles</strong> appeared.  
      The most successful established industry standards: interchangeable cartridges, dedicated processors, and strong game libraries.  
      Third-party developers like <em>Activision</em> and <em>Imagic</em> began producing games independently — a revolutionary change in the business model.
    </aside>


    <!-- Global Competition -->
    <h2>Global Expansion</h2>
    <p>
      The competition wasn’t limited to the United States. In Japan, companies like <strong>Epoch</strong> launched the 
      <em>Cassette Vision</em> (1981), while Europe saw systems like the <em>Interton VC 4000</em> and the 
      <em>Philips Videopac G7000</em> (the European Odyssey²).  
      Each region experimented with its own controllers, cartridges, and marketing.

    <aside class="note">
      By 1983, the market was booming — but dangerously saturated.  
      With multiple consoles, hundreds of games, and inconsistent quality, an inevitable collapse was approaching.
