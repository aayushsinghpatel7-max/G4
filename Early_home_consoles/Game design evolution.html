      <h2>From Simple Interaction to Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        In the early 1970s, home video games were little more than dots and lines moving on a screen.
        Gameplay was limited by the hardware: one button, one goal, and a handful of pixels.
        Yet, even within these limitations, developers began experimenting with
        <strong>competition, cooperation, and creativity</strong>, the foundations of game design.

      <h2>The Birth of Genres</h2>
      <p>
        As technology improved, designers began to explore new kinds of challenges.
        Games were no longer just about reflexes, they started to involve
        <strong>strategy, exploration, and storytelling</strong>.
        Early examples like <em>Adventure</em> (1980) on the Atari 2600
        introduced <em>object interaction</em> and <em>goal-based progression</em>,
        paving the way for genres such as action-adventure and role-playing games.

      <h2>Expanding the Player’s Role</h2>
      <p>
        By the late 1970s, developers began focusing on <strong>player identity</strong> and control.
        Instead of abstract shapes, games introduced recognizable characters such as
        <em>Pac-Man</em> or the ship from <em>Space Invaders</em>.
        This helped players form emotional connections and brought personality to simple mechanics.

        <li><strong>1978 – Space Invaders:</strong> Introduced levels, scoring, and increasing difficulty.</li>
        <li><strong>1980 – Pac-Man:</strong> Added character design and unique enemy behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>1981 – Donkey Kong:</strong> Blended narrative and action, giving birth to the platformer genre.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>From Experiment to Art Form</h2>
      <p>
        Between 1972 and 1983, game design evolved from simple code experiments into a new medium of expression.
        Developers were learning, often by trial and error, how to create challenge, reward, and emotion through interaction.
        Each new console generation brought more memory, more color, and more freedom for imagination.

      <h2>Legacy of Early Game Design</h2>
      <p>
        The principles established during this era still guide modern developers:
        <em>clear goals, responsive control, balanced challenge, and player agency</em>.
        What began as dots on a screen became the groundwork for immersive storytelling and design philosophies that continue to evolve today.
