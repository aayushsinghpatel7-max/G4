</div>



<h3>By the early 1980s, the home console market became overcrowded with competing systems, each trying to stand out with its own game format and marketing strategy. Retailers struggled to keep up, and many consoles quickly became obsolete or incompatible with newer titles, creating confusion for buyers. 
</h3>
<h3>At the same time, third-party developers  rushed to release games without any form of evaluation or approval. This resulted in a massive imbalance between quantity and quality, where low-effort games made it increasingly difficult for players to trust new releases. 
</h3>


<div class="box">
<h3><b>WHAT MADE THE SITUATION UNSTABLE:</b></h3></div>
<div class="content">
<ul>
<li><p>NO STANDARDIZATION. EVERY CONSOLE HAD ITS OWN HARDWARE, CABLES, AND GAME FORMAT</p></li>
<li><p>NEW CONSOLES LAUNCHING BEFORE OLDER ONES WERE SUPPORTED PROPERLY</p></li>
<li><p>RETAIL STORES OVERWHELMED WITH UNSELLABLE STOCK. CONSOLES AND GAMES THAT STOPPED SELLING WITHIN MONTHS</p></li>
<li><p>CONSUMERS BEGAN LOSING CONFIDENCE, UNSURE WHICH PRODUCTS WERE SAFE TO BUY</li></p></div></ul>

<br>
<h3>INSTEAD OF HEALTHY COMPETITION, THE MARKET TURNED INTO CHAOS AND FRAGMENTATION, WHERE EVEN GOOD CONSOLES AND GOOD GAMES WERE BURIED UNDER THE NOISE WHICH SET THE STAGE FOR AN INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLAPSE.
