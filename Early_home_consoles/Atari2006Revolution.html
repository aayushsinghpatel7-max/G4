<h1>Atari 2600 — Hardware & Innovation (1977) </h1>

<h2>As home console technology continued to advance through the late 1970s, the Atari 2600 emerged in 1977 as one of the first systems to fully embrace programmable, computer-like architecture. Unlike earlier consoles that relied on fixed electronic circuits, the Atari 2600 was designed to run different games through software, marking a major evolution in how home gaming systems were built. </h2>

<p>Key technological innovations of the Atari 2600:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Microprocessor Architecture </li>
<p>Powered by an 8-bit MOS 6507 CPU, allowing real-time game logic instead of fixed circuitry. </p>
<li>ROM Cartridge System</li> 
<p>Swappable game cartridges made the console expandable, instead of limited to built-in titles. 
 machine into a reusable, expandable platform. </p>
<li>TV Signal & Graphics Handling </li>
<p>Used a Television Interface Adaptor (TIA) to generate video line-by-line in real time — a method called “racing the beam.” </p>
<li>Controller Design </li>
<p>Introduced a versatile one-button digital joystick, also supporting paddle controllers when needed. </p>
</ul>
