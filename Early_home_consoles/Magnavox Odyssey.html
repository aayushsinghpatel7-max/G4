    <p>
      The <strong>Magnavox Odyssey</strong> was the <strong>first home videogame console</strong>, 
      released in <strong>August 1972</strong> and designed by <strong>Ralph H. Baer</strong>, 
      considered in fact the “Father of Home Video Games.” It connected directly to a TV and opened 
      a new era of entertainment.

    <h2>How It Worked</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>system of interchangeable cards (ancestors of cartridges) to select different games</li>
      <li>absence of sound and color graphics</li>
      <li>came with TV screen overlays for visuals, cards and dice</li>
    </ul>

    <aside class="note">
      The Odyssey didn't have much of a commercial success because the concept of a home video game 
      was so new that many consumers struggled to understand how it worked, and this limited the 
      diffusion of the console. But it still opened the door for future consoles, showing that 
      playing on a television could be interactive.
    </aside>

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>
      The console offered several titles included, including <em>Table Tennis</em>, who was the most popular
      game of the console, and also the one that the game inspired <em>Pong</em>. Between 1972 and 1973, 
      were released 24 video games on Odyssey, most of all about sports or action.
    </p>


    <h3>Consequences</h3>
    <p>
      After <em>Pong's</em> success, <em>Magnavox</em> sued <em>Atari</em> for patent infringement,
      winning the case. In the following years, the company did the same with other giant brands such as 
      <em>Coleco, Mattel</em> and <em>Activision</em>, always obtaining positive results. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1985, <em>Nintendo</em> attempted to invalidate Baer's patents, claiming that the first video 
      game was <em>Tennis for Two (1958)</em>. However the court established that that game did not use 
      video signals and therefore could not be considered a real “video game”.
    </p>
    <p>  
      Despite its technical limitations, the <em>Magnavox Odyssey</em> laid the <strong> foundation of the 
      modern gaming industry</strong>. It showed that electronic <strong>gaming could be a shared</strong>, 
      domestic experience, paving the way for all subsequent consoles, like the <em>Atari 2600</em> or the 
      <em>Nintendo Entertainment System</em>.
