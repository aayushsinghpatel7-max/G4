    <p>
      The PlayStation 1, also known as the PS1, was created by Sony Computer Entertainment and released in 1994 in
      Japan and in 1995 in North America and Europe. It was one of the most important consoles in gaming history,
      competing with the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. The PS1 used CD-ROMs instead of cartridges, which allowed
      games to have better graphics, full soundtracks, and longer stories. Inside, it had a 32-bit processor running at
      33.8 MHz, 2 MB of RAM, and 1 MB of video memory—powerful specs for its time. The console could display graphics up
      to 640×480 pixels and supported 24-channel stereo sound. At first, the controllers were simple, but later Sony
      introduced the famous DualShock controller with vibration and two analog sticks, changing the way players
      interacted with games.

      The PS1 was revolutionary because it brought 3D graphics to a wide audience and made gaming more cinematic and
      immersive. Its use of CDs instead of cartridges allowed developers to include better music and animated scenes,
      making games feel more like movies. Another reason for its success was that it was easy for developers to create
      games for it, which led to a huge variety of genres and styles. Interestingly, the PlayStation was originally
      meant to be a joint project between Sony and Nintendo, but their partnership ended, and Sony decided to continue
      the project alone—a decision that changed gaming history. The colorful PS1 logo, with the red “P” and yellow “S,”
      became an iconic symbol of the 1990s. Overall, the PlayStation 1 sold over 100 million units worldwide and
      established Sony as a major force in the video game industry, leaving a legacy that continues to influence gaming
      today.

      Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Final Fantasy VII, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, Gran Turismo, Resident Evil, Tomb
      Raider, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. These games helped define modern gaming and created franchises
      that still exist today.
