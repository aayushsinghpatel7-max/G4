      The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (officially abbreviated as Super NES or SNES), commonly known as Super
      Nintendo, is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo. In Japan, it was known as the Super Famicom
      (officially abbreviated as Super FC or SFC), and in South Korea, it was distributed as the Hyundai Super Comboy.
      The SNES was Nintendo’s second home console released internationally, following the Nintendo Entertainment System.
      As the successor to the NES, the Super Nintendo featured enhanced graphics, a new controller with additional
      buttons, superior sound, and many improved features.

    <p>
      While not as immediately successful as the original Nintendo Entertainment System, the SNES eventually became a
      formidable competitor in the 16-bit era. It initially trailed behind the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in
      Europe and Japan), though it largely surpassed NEC’s TurboGrafx-16. Over time, the SNES captured first place in
      the generation, proving its strength in both hardware and software offerings.

      The Super Nintendo hosted numerous classic video games, including Super Mario World, Super Metroid, Final
      Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, the original Donkey Kong Country trilogy, Street Fighter II, The Legend of Zelda: A
      Link to the Past, Star Fox, F-Zero, and Super Mario Kart. These titles sold millions of copies and helped cement
      the SNES as the leader of the fourth generation of video game consoles. Third-party developers such as Square,
      Enix, and Capcom played a crucial role in the console’s huge success.
