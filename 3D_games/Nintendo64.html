    <h1>The rise of Nintendo 64</h1>
    <p>The Nintendo 64 (N64), stylized as NINTENDO, is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. Named for its 64-bit processing unit, it was first released in Japan and North America in 1996, followed by Australia, Europe, and other parts of the world in 1997. In South Korea, the console was called Comboy 64 and was distributed by Hyundai instead of Nintendo.
    <h2>Development and design</h2>
    </p>The N64 was Nintendo’s third major home video game console and was originally codenamed Project: Reality while it was being developed by Nintendo and Silicon Graphics (SGI) in April 1993. Their goal was to create a next-generation 3D console. As part of the fifth generation of video game consoles, the N64 marked a major leap from 16-bit sprite-based graphics into a fully 3D polygon world, thanks to its powerful 64-bit CPU and GPU. The SNES had been a 16-bit console, and the Nintendo 64 completely skipped the 32-bit era. It was also Nintendo’s last home console to use cartridges until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017, although Nintendo’s handheld systems continued to support the cartridge format.
    <h3>Cartridges vs CDs</h3>
    <p>Nintendo’s decision to use cartridges instead of CDs caused many third-party developers to turn away from the system. Cartridges were more expensive to produce and had much less storage capacity compared to CDs. In addition, Nintendo was the only supplier, which gave the company full control over licensing. Nintendo defended its decision by saying that cartridges were still the best choice for home consoles because they had no loading times and were more durable and practical than CDs.</p>
    <h4>Legacy and impact</h4>
    <p>At the time, the Nintendo 64 was the only true 64-bit system and the first to offer built-in four-player gaming. Legendary games such as Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, F-Zero X, Super Smash Bros., and GoldenEye 007 helped the console sell over 32 million units worldwide. Although it did not surpass Sony’s PlayStation in sales, the N64 left a lasting mark on gaming history with its innovative controller and true 3D gameplay. Production of the Nintendo 64 ended worldwide in late 2003, but its influence is still felt in modern gaming.</p>
