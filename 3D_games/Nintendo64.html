    <p>
      The Nintendo 64 (N64), stylized as NINTENDO, is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo.
      Named for its 64-bit processing unit, it was first released in Japan and North America in 1996, followed by
      Australia, Europe, and other parts of the world in 1997. In South Korea, the console was called Comboy 64 and
      was distributed by Hyundai instead of Nintendo.

      <p>
        The N64 was Nintendo’s third major home video game console and was originally codenamed Project: Reality
        while it was being developed by Nintendo and Silicon Graphics (SGI) in April 1993. Their goal was to create a
        next-generation 3D console. As part of the fifth generation of video game consoles, the N64 marked a major
        leap from 16-bit sprite-based graphics into a fully 3D polygon world, thanks to its powerful 64-bit CPU and
        GPU. The SNES had been a 16-bit console, and the Nintendo 64 completely skipped the 32-bit era. It was also
        Nintendo’s last home console to use cartridges until the release of the Nintendo Switch in 2017, although
        Nintendo’s handheld systems continued to support the cartridge format.

      <p>
        Nintendo’s decision to use cartridges instead of CDs caused many third-party developers to turn away from the
        system. Cartridges were more expensive to produce and had much less storage capacity compared to CDs. In
        addition, Nintendo was the only supplier, which gave the company full control over licensing. Nintendo
        defended its decision by saying that cartridges were still the best choice for home consoles because they had
        no loading times and were more durable and practical than CDs.
