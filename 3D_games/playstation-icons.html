                    The original PlayStation (PSX) didn't just win the 5th console generation; it redefined gaming as a mainstream, adult-facing hobby. Sony's strategy was built on two pillars: the massive storage capacity of the CD-ROM and a revolutionary marketing campaign that treated games as a cool, cinematic art form.

            <h2>Final Fantasy VII (1997)</h2>
            <p>
                This was the game that brought epic-scale Japanese RPGs to the West. Previously a niche genre, FFVII's 3-disc adventure, combined with its groundbreaking use of pre-rendered backgrounds and cinematic Full-Motion Video (FMV) cutscenes, made it a global phenomenon.

                Hideo Kojima's masterpiece defined a new genre: "Tactical Espionage Action." MGS felt more like an interactive Hollywood blockbuster than a simple game, pioneering complex, adult-oriented plots, extensive voice acting, and fourth-wall-breaking moments that are still discussed today.

                <strong>Breaking the Fourth Wall:</strong> The game famously required the player to

            <h3>Tomb Raider (1996)</h3>
            <p>
                Introduced the world to Lara Croft, arguably the first true 3D video game icon. It defined 3D action-adventure gameplay, combining exploration, puzzles, and platforming in fully realized 3D environments.
            </p>           
            <h3>Resident Evil (1996)</h3>
            <p>
                Capcom coined the term "survival horror" with this game. It masterfully used pre-rendered backgrounds and fixed camera angles (similar to horror films) to build tension and mask the console's limitations.
