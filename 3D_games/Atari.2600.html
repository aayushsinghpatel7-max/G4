    <h1>Birth of Atari</h1>
    <p>The legacy of the Atari 2600 began with the founding of Atari in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. The pair recruited their first engineer, Allan Alcorn, with the goal of creating an arcade video game. Together, they created PONG, which became a massive success and bestseller. Using the funds from the success of PONG, the company began rapidly expanding and hired more engineers.
    <h2> Development of the Atari 2600</h2>
    <p> After the success of PONG, Atari began developing a home console that could be used to play Atari games. After two years of development, the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed the Atari 2600) was released in 1975. With a launch price of $199, Atari aimed to capture the family market, envisioning a world where every home had its own Atari. The console came with two joystick controllers, paddle controllers, and a game cartridge. At launch, there were nine games available for the Atari 2600: Air-Sea Battle, Basic Math, Blackjack Combat, Indy 500, Star Ship, Street Racer, Surround, and Video Olympics. Each game initially had to fit on 2kb cartridges, though 8kb cartridges were eventually used. The Atari sold 400,000 units in its first year and became a major success.</p>
    <h3>Legacy and Impact </h3>
    <p>Production of the Atari 2600 ended in 1992, with approximately 30 million units sold. It was the first home console to use interchangeable game cartridges, allowing one console to play hundreds of different games. This concept was adopted by other companies and became a defining feature of home video game consoles that continues to this day. The Atari 2600 is widely credited with not only revolutionizing the gaming industry, but also creating an entire industry centered around home gaming.</p>
