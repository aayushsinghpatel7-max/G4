        <h1>3D Game gameplay</h1>

        <section>
            <p>
                This page offers an introduction to the dynamic world of 3D game gameplay, where players experience immersive environments and interactive challenges unlike any other genre. In 3D games, movement is possible along all three axes—X, Y, and Z—which opens up vast opportunities for exploration and complex spatial interactions

            <h2>Historical context</h2>
            <p>
                3D gameplay unlocks new mechanics and creative level design. Whether it’s wall running, dynamic traversal, or intricate puzzle-solving within vast open worlds, 3D games showcase the full potential of digital interactivity

            <h2>Core techniques</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interaction and Combat:</strong> Object interaction—picking up, moving, or using in-game items—adds depth, while combat mechanics (attacking, defending, combos) offer both challenge and engagement.
	•	Environment-specific mechanics, such as destructible terrain or dynamic obstacles, further enrich the core gameplay loop.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Loops and Progression:</strong> The core gameplay loop consists of performing a primary action, facing obstacles, receiving feedback, earning rewards, and upgrading abilities or equipment.
	•	Progression systems—such as unlocking tools, new regions, or narrative milestones—motivate players to continue playing and mastering new mechanics.</li>
                <li><strong>3D Asset Creation Techinques:</strong> Core asset creation in 3D games relies on polygonal modeling, digital sculpting, and procedural modeling, each essential for building compelling characters, objects, and environments.
	•	Clean topology, efficient use of vertices and faces, and optimized models ensure smooth performance across different platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement and Camera:</strong> Key movement mechanics include walking, running, jumping, swimming, and advanced traversal like climbing or wall-running.
	•	Camera control is critical: smooth, responsive look speed (yaw and pitch), rotational adjustments, and context-sensitive transitions help players maintain spatial awareness and immersion.</li>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
Legacy gameplay in early 3D games often featured open-world exploration, nonlinear objectives, and emergent interactions, which laid the foundation for modern 3D gaming. Notable early titles like Mercenary (1985) and Super Mario 64 (1996) introduced freedom of movement in expansive worlds and innovative level design. These games allowed players to explore, complete optional tasks, and experience dynamic environments, influencing successors like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998) and Grand Theft Auto III (2001) that expanded on nonlinear storytelling, realistic NPC behaviors, and interaction diversity. Such legacy gameplay emphasized player choice, immersion, and world interactivity, setting the standard for contemporary 3D game design            </p>
