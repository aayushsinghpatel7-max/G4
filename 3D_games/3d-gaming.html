                    The "3D games revolution" refers to the period in the mid-to-late 1990s, primarily the 5th console generation, when 3D graphics went from a novelty to a mainstream standard. This transition was driven by technological advancements like 3D polygon graphics, texture mapping, and hardware acceleration, which enabled more realistic and complex game worlds. Key titles like Super Mario 64 and Virtua Fighter were crucial in demonstrating the potential of 3D environments and gameplay.

                        <h3>Technological Advancements:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The introduction of 3D polygon graphics, along with techniques like texture mapping, Gouraud shading, and anti-aliasing, created more detailed and visually rich environments.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Hardware Acceleration:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The development of dedicated 3D graphics cards (like the 3dfx Voodoo) and APIs like DirectX and OpenGL allowed games to render complex 3D scenes more efficiently.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Console Hardware:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The 5th console generation, including the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Sega Saturn, was designed with 3D gaming in mind.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Larger Storage Media:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The shift from cartridges to CDs provided developers with significantly more storage space for larger worlds, higher-quality audio, and full-motion video.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Analog Controllers:</h3>
                        <p>
                            The introduction of analog sticks on controllers, particularly with the Nintendo 64, provided a new and intuitive way to navigate and control characters in 3D space.
                        </p>
