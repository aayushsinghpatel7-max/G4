                 <p>While consoles battled for the living room, the PC platform defined its own identity through complexity, customization, and community. It was the realm of genres that demanded a mouse and keyboard—from intricate strategy games that simulated entire worlds to the lightning-fast reflexes of the first-person shooter. This era wasn't just about graphics; it was about pushing boundaries and creating the foundation for competitive and community-driven gaming as we know it today.</p>

                <h2 class="glitch">The Dawn of the FPS: DOOM</h1>
                <p>While consoles focused on platformers, the PC became the cradle of the first-person shooter (FPS). id Software's DOOM wasn't just a game; it was a cultural phenomenon. With its pseudo-3D graphics, labyrinthine level design, and fast-paced action, it defined the genre. More importantly, it introduced multiplayer "Deathmatch," planting the seeds for online gaming, and its "moddable" architecture (WADs) gave birth to one of the first content creation communities.</p>

                <h2 class="glitch">The Birth of eSports: StarCraft</h1>
                <p>The PC was the platform of choice for strategy. Games like Dune II and Command & Conquer had already laid the groundwork, but Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft perfected the Real-Time Strategy (RTS) formula. With three unique and perfectly balanced factions (Terran, Zerg, Protoss), an epic story, and a deep multiplayer component, StarCraft became a national sport in South Korea and set the standard for future eSports.</p>
