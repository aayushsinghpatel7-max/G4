      Super Mario first appeared in 1981 in the arcade game Donkey Kong, where he was known as “Jumpman.” He was created by Shigeru Miyamoto for Nintendo. The character quickly became popular because of his simple design and fun gameplay. Later, Nintendo decided to give him his own game and his famous name, Mario.
