    <h1>History of 3D Games</h1>

     <div class="box" style="margin-top:60px;">
    <h1 class="glitch" data-text="Some background">
    <p> 
    The history of 3D games dates back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when developers began experimenting with three-dimensional graphics in video games. One of the earliest examples of 3D graphics in gaming was the game "3D Monster Maze," released in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81. This game featured a first-person perspective and simple wireframe graphics, allowing players to navigate a maze while avoiding a monster.
    There were a lot of technical limitation and important milestones during this period. If we were to go over every major event, this webpage would be endless. 
    So we will go through events that I consider to be the most important ones.

    <h2 class="glitch" data-text="Super Mario 64"> </h2>
    <h2> Super Mario 64 </h2>

    <p>
        Now while it may not be the first ever 3D game made, it was the first to do 3D well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Super Mario 64, released in 1996, was a monumental milestone in video gaming, effectively writing the rulebook for 3D game design and movement. 
        Before its arrival, developers were struggling to transition iconic 2D gameplay into a three-dimensional space, often resulting in clunky controls and confusing camera perspectives. 
        Nintendo’s masterpiece solved these problems with revolutionary innovations that are now standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most critical innovation was its analog control. 
        Paired with the Nintendo 64's new analog stick, the game provided players with 360-degree, pressure-sensitive movement. 
        Mario could tiptoe, walk, run, or dash depending on how far the stick was pushed. 
        This fluid and intuitive control scheme gave the player an unprecedented connection to the character and the 3D world. 
        It was a stark contrast to the rigid, D-pad-based movement of its predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Equally important was its dynamic camera system. 
        Instead of a fixed or rails-based perspective, Super Mario 64 gave players control over their viewpoint. 
        The camera, personified as a friendly Lakitu holding a camera on a fishing pole, could be zoomed, panned, and rotated to frame the action. 
        This allowed players to properly gauge distances, explore complex environments, and appreciate the scale of the world—a vital component for 3D platforming that previous games had failed to master.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the game's level design shattered the linear "A-to-B" structure of 2D platformers. 
        Princess Peach's castle served as a central hub, leading to massive, open "sandbox" worlds contained within paintings. 
        Each world was a playground filled with secrets, encouraging exploration rather than simple completion. 
        Players could tackle a variety of missions (collecting Power Stars) in almost any order they chose, granting a new level of freedom and replayability. 
        These elements—precise analog movement, player-controlled camera, and open-ended 3D worlds—created a blueprint that would define the 3D platformer genre and profoundly influence all 3D games for decades to come, from Banjo-Kazooie to Grand Theft Auto III.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was a short explanation of the importance this game had on the entire gaming industry.

        <h2 class="glitch" data-text="The Modern Golden Age of Consoles"> </h2>
    <h2> The Modern "Golden Age" of Consoles </h2>
    <p> 
        While the 8-bit and 16-bit eras are often nostalgically dubbed the "golden age," many argue the modern golden age began with the seventh console generation (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii) and continues to this day, defined by a revolutionary expansion of what a console is and who it's for. 
        This period's first milestone wasn't just graphical; it was the online revolution. 
        The Xbox 360, in particular, standardized robust online multiplayer, party chat, and a digital storefront (Xbox Live Arcade). 
        This was a fundamental shift, transforming the console from an isolated offline box into a constantly connected entertainment hub. 
        For the first time, games could be patched, updated, and expanded with downloadable content (DLC), and digital-only "indie" games found a platform, sparking a new wave of creativity. 
        Simultaneously, Nintendo shattered the market's boundaries with the Wii's motion controls. 
        This milestone proved that innovative input, not just graphical power, could be a system's primary driver, attracting a massive new audience of families and "non-gamers" and forcing Sony and Microsoft to follow suit with their own motion-control peripherals
    </p> 

    <p>
        Building on these foundations, the eighth and ninth generations introduced milestones that redefined accessibility and hardware. 
        The next great hardware leap came from Nintendo again with the Nintendo Switch, which perfectly executed the hybrid console concept. 
        By seamlessly dissolving the barrier between a high-definition home console and a portable handheld, the Switch created a new paradigm of play-anywhere convenience that became a massive quality-of-life milestone for players. 
        As hardware matured, the most recent and perhaps most disruptive milestone has been in the business model: the rise of subscription services. 
        Spearheaded by Xbox Game Pass, this "Netflix for games" model has fundamentally changed how players access and consume games. 
        Instead of a 70 dollar-per-game retail transaction, players now have access to a vast, rotating library of hundreds of titles for a monthly fee, which has in turn altered development and publishing strategies. 
        This is all supported by a crucial technological milestone: the move from mechanical hard drives to custom solid-state drives (SSDs) in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, which have virtually eliminated loading times, a long-standing friction point in game design. 
        This convergence of persistent online connectivity, diverse input methods, hardware flexibility, and all-access subscription models makes the modern era an unparalleled golden age of choice and accessibility for gamers.

        <h2 class="glitch" data-text="Modern Gaming"> </h2>
    <h2> Modern Gaming </h>
    <p>
        Modern gaming is defined less by graphical leaps and more by a fundamental restructuring of how games are developed, distributed, and consumed, turning it into the world's most dominant and integrated entertainment medium. 
        Perhaps the single most transformative milestone was the rise of mobile gaming, sparked by the Apple App Store in 2008. 
        This didn't just create a new market; it redefined the "gamer," bringing billions of new players into the ecosystem through accessible, often "free-to-play" (F2P) titles. 
        This model, funded by microtransactions, would soon bleed into all other sectors. 
        This new digital-first landscape also enabled the indie game revolution. Digital distribution platforms, most notably Steam on PC, shattered the traditional publisher model, allowing small teams to create and sell games globally without needing a massive budget or a physical disc. 
        This democratization of development led to a creative explosion, producing culture-defining hits like Minecraft and Stardew Valley that prioritized novel ideas over graphical fidelity.
    </p>

    <p> 
        This "always-online" environment set the stage for the next major milestone: the "Games as a Service" (GaaS) model. 
        Pioneered by MMOs but perfected by titles like Fortnite and League of Legends, this concept shifted games from a one-time, 60 dollar product into an ongoing, evolving platform. 
        Through a steady stream of seasonal content, battle passes, and updates, GaaS games are designed to retain a player base for years, becoming a continuous hobby rather than a finite experience. 
        Finally, a profound cultural milestone cemented gaming's dominance: the rise of streaming and esports. 
        The launch of Twitch in 2011 turned playing video games into a massive spectator sport. 
        This created a new class of celebrity (streamers), a new multi-billion dollar industry (esports), and a new way to market games, where a game's "watchability" became as important as its "playability." 
        Together, these milestones—mobile's mass-market accessibility, the indie scene's creativity, the GaaS model's endless engagement, and streaming's cultural power—define the modern gaming era.
