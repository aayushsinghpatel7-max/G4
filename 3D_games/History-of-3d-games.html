    <h1>History of 3D Games</h1>

   
    <p> 
    The history of 3D games dates back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when developers began experimenting with three-dimensional graphics in video games. One of the earliest examples of 3D graphics in gaming was the game "3D Monster Maze," released in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81. This game featured a first-person perspective and simple wireframe graphics, allowing players to navigate a maze while avoiding a monster.
    There were a lot of technical limitation and important milestones during this period. If we were to go over every major event, this webpage would be endless. 
    So we will go through events that I consider to be the most important ones.

    <h2> Super Mario 64 </h2>

    <p>
        Now while it may not be the first ever 3D game made, it was the first to do 3D well. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Super Mario 64, released in 1996, was a monumental milestone in video gaming, effectively writing the rulebook for 3D game design and movement. 
        Before its arrival, developers were struggling to transition iconic 2D gameplay into a three-dimensional space, often resulting in clunky controls and confusing camera perspectives. 
        Nintendo’s masterpiece solved these problems with revolutionary innovations that are now standard.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most critical innovation was its analog control. 
        Paired with the Nintendo 64's new analog stick, the game provided players with 360-degree, pressure-sensitive movement. 
        Mario could tiptoe, walk, run, or dash depending on how far the stick was pushed. 
        This fluid and intuitive control scheme gave the player an unprecedented connection to the character and the 3D world. 
        It was a stark contrast to the rigid, D-pad-based movement of its predecessors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Equally important was its dynamic camera system. 
        Instead of a fixed or rails-based perspective, Super Mario 64 gave players control over their viewpoint. 
        The camera, personified as a friendly Lakitu holding a camera on a fishing pole, could be zoomed, panned, and rotated to frame the action. 
        This allowed players to properly gauge distances, explore complex environments, and appreciate the scale of the world—a vital component for 3D platforming that previous games had failed to master.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the game's level design shattered the linear "A-to-B" structure of 2D platformers. 
        Princess Peach's castle served as a central hub, leading to massive, open "sandbox" worlds contained within paintings. 
        Each world was a playground filled with secrets, encouraging exploration rather than simple completion. 
        Players could tackle a variety of missions (collecting Power Stars) in almost any order they chose, granting a new level of freedom and replayability. 
        These elements—precise analog movement, player-controlled camera, and open-ended 3D worlds—created a blueprint that would define the 3D platformer genre and profoundly influence all 3D games for decades to come, from Banjo-Kazooie to Grand Theft Auto III.

        This was a short explanation of the importance this game had on the entire gaming industry.
