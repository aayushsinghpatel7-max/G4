    <p>The true revolution of the last few decades wasn't just graphics; it was connection. The advent of broadband internet transformed gaming from a solitary hobby into a mass social experience. Persistent worlds, global competitive arenas, and entire digital economies were born, forever changing how we play, compete, and interact.</p>

      <h2>Living in Another World: World of Warcraft</h2>
      <p>"Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games" (MMORPGs) created persistent digital worlds where thousands of players coexisted. If Ultima Online (1997) wrote the rules, Blizzard's World of Warcraft (WoW) perfected the formula, making it accessible and engaging for millions. WoW wasn't just a game; it was a "second place" and a social phenomenon for an entire generation.</p>

      <h2>The Competitive Explosion: From Counter-Strike to Fortnite</h2>
      <p>The online revolution also fueled competition. Born as a mod for Half-Life in 1999, Counter-Strike defined the tactical, team-based shooter and dominated "cyber cafés" worldwide. Decades later, the rise of "Battle Royale" games like Fortnite (2017) combined the thrill of survival with a "free-to-play" model and social phenomenon (live events, skins), becoming a global cultural touchstone.</p>
