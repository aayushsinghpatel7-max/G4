            <h1 class="glitch">AI in Gaming</h1>
            <!--Introduction-->
            <p>
                Ai in game development and the gaming industry refers to the use of artificial intelligence 
                to create intelligent and adaptive behaviours in non-player characters (NPCs), enhance game design 
                and personalize player experiences.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Where is AI Enhancing Game Development</h2>
            <h3>NPC behaviour</h3>
            <p>
                Until now, non-player characters have only existed to further the storyline in certain pre-programed ways, 
                a player would only be able to interact with them with specific questions and would receive a set of specific set 
                of responses. With new AI advancements the possibilities are becoming virtually limitless, interacting with NPCs may 
                soon be just like have a conversation with a real person.
            </p>
            <h3>Creating game assets</h3>
            <p>
                Each frame of a game is made up of a staggering number of art assets. For example, an empty street has elements like 
                stones, trees, shrubs, puddles and many more, these elements represent many hours of hard work done by game designers 
                and artists. With AI driven asset creation, this is becoming faster and easier, this in turn paves the way for artists 
                to create entire worlds with ease, without the time-consuming task of designing individual and repetitive elements.
            </p>
            <h3>Player Experience Modelling(PEM)</h3>
            <p>
                Player’s data can be analysed with AI to generate insights about their skills, preferences and behaviours. This enables 
                game developers to offer customised gameplay options, for example, if a player shows a preference for inspecting each 
                element in a room, PEM innovations will adapt the game to include more of such elements for them to find and interact 
                with. Similarly, it can also adjust difficulty levels based on a player’s capabilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Automated playtesting</h3>
            <p>
                Before a game is released, it is tested out to identify any bugs and glitches, spot loopholes, and to check out the 
                feasibility of various difficult levels. When tested by humans, it can take months, but now with AI playtesting it is 
                significantly reducing this time by scanning thousands of test scenarios in a matter of days, leading to faster production times. 
            </p>
            <h3>Enhanced storytelling</h3>
            <p>
                Traditionally the storyline of a game is pre imagined by the developers, and every player plays it out with minor variations. 
                For example, two players can take different routes but in the end they will reach the same place. With AI’s generative 
                capabilities, unlimited storylines become a real possibility. A player can play a game knowing that each action they take will 
                lead to a diverse set of scenarios unfolding with new assets and worlds being created in real time.

            <h2>Pros and cons of AI in game development</h2>
            <div class="box">
                <h3>Pros of AI in Gaming</h3>
            <p>
                As previously mentioned, the obvious advantage will be a deeply immersive and highly personalised gamming experience. 
                After all you are bound to enjoy a game that seems to be made just for you with elements you like, a storyline that you 
                find interesting and with a difficulty level that’s just challenging enough to keep you intrigued, and in the context 
                of multiplayer games, AI can also help measure fair play by using advanced algorithms to detect cheating.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Cons and ethical considerations</h3>
            <p>
                One of the primary concerns with AI is data security, as highly personalised game play requires in depth analysis and 
                tracing of player data. So, game developers need to invest in top notch security protocols and maintain transparency to 
                assure players how their data is being gathered, stored and used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, many developers and gamers are concerned about the flipside of unlimited storylines and world building, 
                while limitless options sound great, these worlds will necessarily have to be AI generated with little to no human 
                influence. This all leads to the possibility of gaming jobs being impacted, with AI replacing human professionals. 
                
            </p>

                Not necessarily taking over the jobs, but reducing the amount of available work.
