            <h1>Live service games and Evolving worlds</h1>
            <p>
                A live service game, often categorized under the broader term Games as a Service, is a type of 
                video game structured around continuous content delivery and monetization. This approach alters 
                how players interact with games, so instead of playing through a fixed story line and forgetting 
                about the game afterwards, players are encouraged to return regularly to participate in events 
                or to unlock limited time awards.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Key characteristics:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular Content Updates: This may include new levels, items, story arcs, characters, or gameplay modes. 
                    Updates are often have themes and timed around seasons or chapters.</li>
                <li>Persistent Online Connectivity: Most live service games require a constant internet connection, even for single-player content.</li>
                <li>Monetization Beyond the Initial Sale: Rather than relying solely on unit sales(although many are free to play), 
                    these games generate revenue through microtransactions, in-game currencies, cosmetics, battle passes, and sometimes subscriptions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Notable examples</h2>
            <p>These are some of the most successful live service games:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fortnite: Updated biweekly with new cosmetics, map changes and collaborative events.</li>
                <li>Destiny 2: Features rolling expansions and seasons that introduce narrative arcs and activities.</li>
                <li>World of Warcraft and League of legends: These are long standing examples of live service games that 
                    depend on an evolving world to keep players engaged and to provide continuous action.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>The first Live Service game</h2>
            <p>
                One of the first mainstream live service games was RuneScape which was launched in 2001. 
                It was a browser based, free to play and supported with regular content updates. A similar 
                case was World of Warcraft, which used paid expansions and a subscription model to support 
                continuous updates. These games provided the basic concept: persistent online experiences 
                increase both engagement and revenue.</p>
            <p>The genre defining moment was in 2017 with the success of Fortnite: Battle Royal, its seasonal model, 
                with the regular balance changes and an ever evolving in-game world. This became the blueprint for future 
                live service games, Aswell as the use of a free to play model with cosmetic monetization was especially influential.</p>
