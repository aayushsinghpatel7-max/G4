  <!-- AR Overview Box -->
  <div class="box">
    <h2>Augmented Reality: From Novelty to Mainstream</h2>
    <p>Augmented Reality (AR) in mobile gaming is no longer just a novelty — it's becoming a core part of how games are designed, how players engage, and how the physical and digital worlds merge. Smartphones, tablets, and soon AR glasses are enabling experiences where virtual content blends with real-world surroundings, making “play” part of everyday life.</p>
    <p>The current AR status shows steady growth: the global AR gaming market was valued around <strong>US $28.3 Billion in 2024</strong> and is projected to reach approximately <strong>US $142.4 Billion by 2030</strong>, with a compound annual growth rate of ~30.9%.</p>

          <h3>Current Status of Mobile AR Gaming</h3>
          <p>Well-known mobile AR titles such as <em>Pokémon GO</em> and <em>Ingress Prime</em> pioneered location-based augmented experiences, using GPS, camera and sensors to place virtual objects in the physical world.</p>
          <p>Recent research demonstrates advances in mobile AR technology: for example a systematic review in May 2025 highlighted themes such as improved tracking, marker-based games, and mobile AR as a viable gaming platform.</p>

        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h3>Recent Breakthroughs & Emerging Technologies</h3>
          <p>Several breakthroughs are enhancing mobile AR's potential:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>AI & on-device intelligence:</strong> Companies like Arm released new innovations (e.g., ExecuTorch 1.0) for edge AI which enable low-latency, power-efficient AR experiences running directly on mobile/AR hardware.</li>
            <li><strong>Wearable AR hardware:</strong> The launch of platforms such as Android XR (in partnership with Samsung) and smart-glasses announcements at Meta Connect 2025 point toward mainstream AR devices beyond phones.</li>
            <li><strong>Location & geospatial AI:</strong> Niantic Spatial is extending AR into persistent, location-aware worlds, with AI companions and real-world overlays.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These developments enable mobile AR games to become more immersive, context-aware, and socially connected.</p>

        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h3>Future Speculation: What Comes Next</h3>
          <p>Looking ahead, mobile AR gaming might evolve in the following ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Persistent AR worlds:</strong> Shared, persistent overlays in the real world where multiple players leave lasting virtual objects or experiences tied to locations.</li>
            <li><strong>AR glasses as primary devices:</strong> As lightweight AR glasses become viable, mobile AR gaming may transition from handheld screens to wearable displays, offering more seamless and immersive experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Hybrid AR/AI companions:</strong> Intelligent AR characters that interact with your environment, guide you, learn your habits, and become part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-platform integration:</strong> AR games syncing seamlessly across mobile, console, and wearable devices — e.g., you start a quest on phone, continue on AR glasses, and join friends in VR.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-world gamification:</strong> AR games merging with fitness, exploration, education, and social tasks — walking in a park becomes a game level, museum visits become interactive quests.</li>
            <li><strong>Ultra-low latency multiplayer AR:</strong> With 5G/6G networks, edge computing, and high-precision tracking, AR multiplayer will rival traditional e-sports in responsiveness and scale.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Challenges & Considerations</h3>
          <aside class="warning">
            <strong>Warning:</strong> While promising, mobile AR gaming faces hurdles such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Hardware cost and power consumption for AR devices.</li>
              <li>Privacy and safety issues when overlaying virtual content in public spaces.</li>
              <li>Content creation scale - design of persistent AR worlds is complex and resource‑intensive.</li>
              <li>Network, tracking, and latency limitations in large‑scale multiplayer AR experiences.</li>
            </ul>
          </aside>
          <p>Addressing these challenges will determine whether mobile AR gaming reaches its full potential.</p>

    <h2>Towards a New Era of Mobile Play</h2>
    <p>Mobile AR gaming stands at the intersection of technology, creativity, and real-world interaction. With advances in AI, wearable hardware, geospatial tracking, and cloud/edge computing, the line between “virtual” and “real” continues to blur. Gamers may soon find themselves navigating real cities, collaborating in shared AR worlds, and interacting with intelligent AR characters beyond the screen.</p>
    <p>In this next phase, mobile devices — whether phones, glasses or AR-enabled wearables — will not just host games, they will be the game world. The future of mobile AR gaming is immersive, social, and grounded in real space.</p>
    <p>Get ready for gaming where your world becomes the playground.</p>
