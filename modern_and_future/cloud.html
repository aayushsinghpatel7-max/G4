        <h1>Cloud Computing: From Physical Cartridges to Infinite Game Libraries</h1>
        <p>
            Video games once relied entirely on physical media &rarr; cartridges, discs, and local installations. But as
            cloud infrastructure expanded, the need for powerful personal hardware began to fade. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><i>Cloud gaming</i></a>, also
            known as gaming on demand, allows the game to run on remote servers while streaming the visual and audio
            output to the player's device. This shift makes it possible for anyone with a stable connection to enjoy
            high-performance gaming without owning a high-end console or PC.

            Early cloud gaming attempts, such as <i>OnLive</i> and <i>Gaikai</i> in the 2010s, faced major challenges
            like latency, unstable connections, and bandwidth limits. As network technology improved - faster broadband,
            better compression, and globally distributed data centers - cloud gaming experienced a resurgence. According
            to <a
                href="https://go.abiresearch.com/hubfs/Marketing/Whitepapers/The%20Past%2C%20Present%2C%20and%20Future%20of%20Cloud%20Gaming/ABI_Research%20The%20Past%20Present%20And%20Future%20Of%20Cloud%20Gaming.pdf">
                ABI Research</a>, advances in cloud infrastructure and the spread of 5G are setting the stage for the
            next era of large-scale, low-latency cloud-based gaming.

        <h3>Key Highlights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud gaming runs the game on remote servers and streams it to the player's screen.</li>
            <li>The model removes hardware barriers, relying mainly on internet quality and server infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Early systems struggled with lag and connection issues but paved the way for modern solutions.</li>
            <li>Major advantages: accessibility, instant play, and device independence.</li>
            <li>Ongoing challenges: latency, global infrastructure, and maintaining consistent quality of service.</li>
        </ul>

            Today, cloud gaming is reshaping the way games are distributed and experienced. Players can stream titles
            instantly on phones, laptops, or smart TVs, without lengthy downloads or expensive hardware. This marks a
            fundamental shift in gaming history - from "owning a game for my console" to "accessing my games anywhere,
            anytime." As network coverage and computing power continue to grow, experts predict that cloud-based gaming
            platforms will soon dominate the global market.
