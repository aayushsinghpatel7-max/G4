        <h1>Cloud Computing: From Physical Cartridges to Infinite Game Libraries</h1>
        <p>
            Video games once relied entirely on physical media &rarr; cartridges, discs, and local installations. But as
            cloud infrastructure expanded, the need for powerful personal hardware began to fade. <em>Cloud gaming</em>,
            also known as gaming on demand, allows the game to run on remote servers while streaming the visual and
            audio output to the player's device. This shift makes it possible for anyone with a stable connection to
            enjoy high-performance gaming without owning a high-end console or PC.
        </p>

                    Early cloud gaming attempts, such as <i>OnLive</i> and <i>Gaikai</i> in the 2010s, faced major
                    challenges like latency, unstable connections, and bandwidth limits. As network technology improved
                    - faster broadband, better compression, and globally distributed data centers - cloud gaming
                    experienced a resurgence. According to ABI Research, advances in cloud infrastructure and the spread
                    of 5G are setting the stage for the next era of large-scale, low-latency cloud-based gaming.

        <h2>Hierarchy of Needs for Cloud Gaming</h2>
        <p>
            To succeed, cloud gaming must evolve through several layers of development - starting from a strong
            technical foundation and building toward full-scale user adoption. At its core, the system relies on
            stable infrastructure, low latency, and seamless content delivery across regions. Once those basics
            are achieved, services can focus on richer libraries, player retention, and delivering experiences
            that truly compete with traditional local gaming, <em>as shown in Figure 1</em>.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            In practice, the industry is now transitioning from solving technical challenges to enhancing value —
            improving content quality, minimizing delays, and expanding accessibility across all devices.

         Conclusion
         ========================================= -->
    <div class="box">
        <p>
            Today, cloud gaming is reshaping the way games are distributed and experienced. Players can stream titles
            instantly on phones, laptops, or smart TVs, without lengthy downloads or expensive hardware. This marks a
            fundamental shift in gaming history - from "owning a game for my console" to "accessing my games anywhere,
            anytime."
        </p>

        <p>
            However, success in this field depends on finding the right balance between <strong>technology</strong> and
            <strong>market forces</strong>. Companies must manage infrastructure costs, performance optimization, and
            innovation while ensuring the service remains affordable and appealing to players, <em>as shown in Figure
                2</em>.
