    <p>
      As immersion grows, the interface must move closer to the body — from controllers and gloves
      to eye, hand, and even brain signals. Haptics brings touch into digital worlds; neural I/O seeks
      direct communication with the nervous system.

            <h3>Scientists Have Developed a Wearable System for Natural Digital Interaction</h3>
            <p>
              Touch plays a vital role in human connection, fostering trust, emotional bonds, and reducing stress.
              Yet in today’s digital world, where screens mediate most interactions, it’s often missing.
              To bridge this gap, researchers at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering developed a wearable haptic
              system that lets users exchange gestures like pats, handshakes, and squeezes in virtual reality —
              and feel them in real time. The system uses gloves and sleeves with small vibration motors to simulate
              pressure and movement, making virtual interactions more engaging, pleasant, and realistic.

          <div style="flex:1;min-width:300px;">
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>
              The system supports up to 16 users at once, each represented by a full-body 3D avatar mirroring
              real movements in a shared virtual environment. Unlike video calls, users can move freely,
              interact with objects, and complete tasks together. To add touch, users wear gloves and armbands
              with vibration motors that simulate pressure and motion, allowing them to feel gestures and object
              interactions in VR. Tests showed participants felt a stronger sense of presence and connection
              with tactile feedback.

          <h3>Reconnecting Through Touch</h3>
          <p>
            The global shift toward online communication, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has made connecting
            easier than ever but also introduced new challenges. Despite constant digital interaction, many people —
            especially younger generations — continue to experience loneliness, anxiety, and depression.
            Video platforms such as Zoom and FaceTime keep families, friends, and colleagues visually and verbally
            connected but still lack the physical interaction essential for emotional well-being.
            While this technology cannot replace real human contact, it offers valuable ways to enhance social
            interaction when physical presence is impossible.
            The USC researchers note that their system could help patients and families in hospitals and care
            facilities share comforting touch across distances, support collaboration in remote workplaces and
            classrooms, and strengthen emotional closeness between loved ones separated by distance.
            Human touch remains vital to mental health, and bringing it into virtual environments marks an
            important step toward creating more meaningful digital connections.

        <h2>The Future of Interaction in Virtual Reality</h2>
        <p>
          The future of virtual reality goes far beyond sight and sound. Researchers are working to recreate
          the full spectrum of human sensation — touch, smell, temperature, and even pain — to make digital
          experiences feel truly real. Advances in haptic feedback will allow users to feel pressure, texture,
          and motion with unprecedented accuracy through wearable sensors and neural interfaces. Olfactory
          technology is being developed to reproduce scents that match virtual environments, enhancing immersion
          and emotional realism. Meanwhile, pain simulation — carefully calibrated for safety — is being explored
          to train soldiers, athletes, and surgeons, providing a realistic sense of physical consequence.

        <p>
          These innovations aim to bridge the final gap between human perception and virtual experience.
          By engaging all five senses, future VR could transform not just gaming, but also healthcare,
          education, therapy, and remote communication — creating a world where the digital feels
          indistinguishable from reality.
