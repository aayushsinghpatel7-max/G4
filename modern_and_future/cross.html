        <h1>Cross-Platform Technology: Breaking the Barriers Between</h1>
        <p>
            In the early era of video games, each platform operated in its own isolated ecosystem - consoles, PCs and
            mobiles all had separate networks and rarely allowed players to interact across device types. According to
            historical records, early attempts at cross-platform play emerged in the 2000s but remained exceptional due
            to technical and business constraints.

         Analysis & conclusion 
         Purpose: explains challenges and modern impact of cross-play 
         ====================== -->
    <div class="box">
        <p>
            The shift toward cross-platform play required overcoming multiple challenges: differences in hardware,
            network protocols, matchmaking systems, and even business strategies that kept ecosystems separate. For
            example, on PCs, different operating systems (Windows, OS X, Linux) gradually became interoperable via
            services like Steam expanding beyond Windows in 2010 and 2013.
            <br>
            As these foundations matured, developers and platform-holders began to craft tools and policies to allow
            players on consoles and PCs to play together - paving the way for modern cross-play standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, cross-platform play is a major expectation in many multiplayer games: players insist on being able to
            play with friends regardless of device. As the blog from Pearl Academy notes, the rise of this feature is
            "rapidly changing this decades-long trend of platform exclusivity".
            <br>
            Going forward, we can expect deeper integration: saving progress across devices, seamless matchmaking across
            platforms, and unified social ecosystems - meaning that games no longer just support multiple platforms,
            they connect them.
