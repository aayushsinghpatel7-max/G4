    <h1>Cross-Platform Technology: Breaking the Barriers Between</h1>

    <p>
        In the early era of video games, each platform operated in its own isolated ecosystem - consoles, PCs and
        mobiles all had separate networks and rarely allowed players to interact across device types. According to
        historical records, early attempts at cross-platform play emerged in the 2000s but remained exceptional due to
        technical and business constraints.
    </p>

    <h3>Famous Cross-Platform Games</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Final Fantasy XI</i> &rarr; one of the first games to connect PlayStation 2 and PC players in
            the same online world.</li>
        <li><i>Rocket League</i> &rarr; became a major symbol of cross-play success, allowing PC, PlayStation,
            Xbox, and Switch users to compete together.</li>
        <li><i>Fortnite</i> &rarr; broke console barriers in 2018 when all major platforms agreed to enable
            full cross-play after massive player demand.</li>
        <li><i>Minecraft</i> &rarr; now fully unified under the "Bedrock Edition," letting mobile, console,
            and PC players share worlds seamlessly.</li>
        <li><i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> &rarr; introduced synchronized updates and matchmaking across PC and
            consoles, redefining large-scale multiplayer.</li>
        <li><i>Genshin Impact</i> &rarr; offers mobile, console, and PC cross-play with shared accounts,
            proving how global online communities can thrive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The shift toward cross-platform play required overcoming multiple challenges: differences in hardware, network
        protocols, matchmaking systems, and even business strategies that kept ecosystems separate. For example, on PCs,
        different operating systems (Windows, OS X, Linux) gradually became interoperable via services like Steam
        expanding beyond Windows in 2010 and 2013.

        As these foundations matured, developers and platform-holders began to craft tools and policies to allow players
        on consoles and PCs to play together - paving the way for modern cross-play standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, cross-platform play is a major expectation in many multiplayer games: players insist on being able to
        play with friends regardless of device. As the blog from Pearl Academy notes, the rise of this feature is
        "rapidly changing this decades-long trend of platform exclusivity".
        <br>
        Going forward, we can expect deeper integration: saving progress across devices, seamless matchmaking across
        platforms, and unified social ecosystems - meaning that games no longer just support multiple platforms, they
        connect them.
