    <h1>Cross-Platform as a Service: A New Era of Unified Gaming Ecosystems</h1>

    <h3>From a Feature to a Framework</h3>
    <p>
        Cross-platform play started as a novelty - a way to connect players from different devices. Today, it's evolving
        into a complete service model. Instead of treating each platform as a separate world, companies now build
        interconnected ecosystems where progress, purchases, and communities are shared. Players no longer ask "Can I
        play with my friends?" but expect "My account should work anywhere."
    </p>

    <h3>The Business of Seamless Access</h3>
    <p>
        Delivering games as a unified service requires more than technical compatibility - it demands business
        alignment. Studios are embracing cloud integration, shared databases, and subscription models that keep players
        engaged across all devices. This approach transforms games from one-time sales into long-term services. For
        developers, it means simplified updates, faster global releases, and access to a much wider player base.

    <h3>Industry Leaders & Milestones</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Microsoft (Xbox / Game Pass)</i> &rarr; one of the pioneers of cross-platform as a service, merging
            console, PC, and cloud into a single ecosystem with shared subscriptions and cloud saves.</li>
        <li><i>Sony Interactive Entertainment</i> &rarr; after initially resisting cross-play, Sony embraced it through
            services like PlayStation Network and support for major titles like <i>Fortnite</i> and <i>Call of Duty:
                Warzone.</i></li>
        <li><i>Epic Games</i> &rarr; led the push toward full cross-platform support, creating the Epic Online Services
            SDK to help other developers build their own cross-play infrastructures.</li>
        <li><i>Nintendo</i> &rarr; joined the ecosystem through collaborations that allow <i>Fortnite</i> and <i>Rocket
                League</i> to function across Switch, consoles, and PC, showing even handheld devices can join the
            network.</li>
        <li><i>Google & NVIDIA</i> &rarr; contributed through cloud gaming infrastructure (Stadia, GeForce Now), showing
            how scalable backends can power real-time cross-device play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Connected Futures</h3>
    <p>
        The future of gaming lies in universal access. A player can start a session on Xbox, continue on PC, and check
        progress from a mobile app. For the industry, this cross-platform service approach is redefining what it means
        to "own" a game. Publishers aim to create consistent, device-agnostic experiences - where you don't just buy a
        product, you join a living digital ecosystem.
