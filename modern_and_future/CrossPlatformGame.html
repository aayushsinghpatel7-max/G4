                <h2>Fortnite</h2>
                <p>Developed by Epic Games, Fortnite is the game that forced cross-play into the main-
                    stream. It refused to keep its player-base in "walled gardens" and, through its massive
                    popularity, essentially pressured platform holders like Sony to open their networks.
                    Fortnite’s success is built on a single, unified Epic Games account.

                <ul>
                    <li>Player Base: As of 2024, the game has over 500 million registered accounts.</li>

                    <li>Monetization: The "Battle Pass" and item shop are tied to the player’s account
                        (cross-progression), meaning a skin bought on a PlayStation is available when they
                        log in on their PC or Android phone.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div name="Minecraft">
                <h2>Minecraft</h2>
                <p>While Fortnite is the modern-day champion, Minecraft (Mojang/Microsoft) is the quiet
                   giant. Its "Bedrock Edition" was specifically engineered to unify players across consoles,
                   mobile, and Windows PCs, allowing them to collaborate on the same worlds.
                   Minecraft’s cross-play is built for social creativity.

                <ul>
                    <li>Sales: It is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies
                        sold as of late 2023.</li>
                    <li>Active Users: It maintains a staggering 140 million monthly active users,
                        many of whom rely on cross-play to connect with friends.</li>
                    <li>The Ecosystem: The "Bedrock" engine ensures that a player on an iPhone can

            <div name="Conclusion">
                <h3>Fortnite VS Minecraft</h3>
                <p>Both Fortnite and Minecraft prove that the "best" cross-platform experience is one that
                   makes the underlying hardware irrelevant. They make the player’s account and social
                   graph the center of the experience. Fortnite excels in the competitive, event-driven space,
                   while Minecraft provides the ultimate creative social sandbox.
