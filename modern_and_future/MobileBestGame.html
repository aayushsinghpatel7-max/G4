                <h1>Defining the "Best" Mobile Game: An Analysis</h1>
            </div>

            <div name="Genshin">
                <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>
                <p>Developed by miHoYo, Genshin Impact redefined what a free-to-play mobile game could
                    be. It’s a massive open-world RPG with stunning graphics and deep gameplay, rivaling
                    console titles.
                    Genshin Impact is a monetization powerhouse. It achieved this status not just through
                    gameplay, but through a "gacha" system that is deeply integrated into the player’s pro-
                    gression.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Revenue: It is one of the fastest games to reach $4 billion in lifetime revenue
                        (as of 2023) on mobile platforms.</li>
                    <li>Player Spending: It consistently earns over $1 billion annually from its player
                        base.</li>
                    <li>Demographics: It shattered the "casual" mobile stereotype, attracting a dedi-
                        cated core gamer audience with average play sessions exceeding 30 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div name="CandyCrush">
                <h2>Candy Crush Saga</h2>
                <p>If Genshin Impact represents the "core" gamer, Candy Crush Saga (King) represents
                    total market saturation and longevity. Launched in 2012, it remains a dominant force in
                    the "casual gaming" space.
                    Candy Crush’s success is built on a perfectly addictive puzzle loop, social integration,
                    and a "freemium" model that monetizes small, high-value purchases.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Downloads: The game has been downloaded over 3 billion times life-to-date.</li>
                    <li>Revenue: A decade after its launch, it still generates over $1 billion per year,
                        proving its incredible longevity.</li>
                    <li>User Base: Its "best" status comes from its reach. It appeals to a demographic
                        that traditional gaming often misses, with a player base that is predominantly
                        female (over 60%).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div name="Conclusion">
                <h2>Genshin Impact VS Candy Crush Saga</h2>
                <p>There is no single "best." The data shows a split. Genshin Impact is the "best" technical
                    and immersive achievement, proving that complex, high-fidelity games can thrive on
                    mobile. Candy Crush Saga isthe"best"casualphenomenon,demonstratinghowasimple,
                    perfect loop can create a multi-decade, multi-billion dollar empire.
