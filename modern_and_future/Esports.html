            <h2>The evolution of Esports</h2>
            <p>
                One of the first recorded competitive gaming events took place in 1972 at Stanford university, where students competed 
                in a game called Spacewar! for a years subscription to the Rolling Stone magazine. The esports scene started to gain 
                momentum in the 1980s with the rise of arcade games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, along with the launch of competitions 
                such as the Video Game World Championships hosted by Atari.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1990 Nintendo’s World Championships brought further attention to the competitive gaming scene, but it was the growth 
                of online and PC gaming in the late 1990s and early 2000s that transformed esports. Populare games such as StarCraft, 
                Counter-strike and Quake started international Esports tournaments, while the rise of broadband internet enabled players 
                to compete globally.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the 2010s, the introduction of platforms like Twitch and the professionalisation of leagues for games like League of 
                Legends and Dota 2 firmly established esports as a major form of entertainment, attracting millions of viewers and substantial prize pools.
