                Factor</h1>

                <h2 class="glitch">Half-Life: Alyx</h2>
                <p>Developed by Valve, Half-Life: Alyx is widely considered the "killer app" for PC VR. It’s
                    a full-length, narrative-driven, first-person shooter that set a new benchmark for what a
                    AAA-quality VR game could be.
                    Alyx ’s success is measured by its impact on the industry and its critical reception.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Critical Acclaim: The game holds a 98% positive rating on Steam and a
                        93 on Metacritic, making it one of the highest-rated games of all time, VR or
                        otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Industry Impact: Alyx was a platform seller. Data showed that the Valve Index
                        headset (Valve’s own hardware) saw its sales more than double in the quarter of
                        the game’s release.</li>
                    <li>Mechanics: Its physics-based puzzles and "gravity gloves" are not gimmicks; they
                        are core to the experience, creating intuitive interactions that are only possible in
                        VR.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="box content" name="BeatSaber">
                <h2 class="glitch">Beat Saber</h2>
                <p>If Alyx is the "core" experience, Beat Saber (Beat Games) is the "mainstream" phe-
                    nomenon. It is a rhythm game where players slice musical blocks with laser swords. Its
                    simplicity is its genius.
                    Beat Saber ’s brilliance is its accessibility. It’s a perfect "first-time" VR experience and a
                    high-skill-ceiling rhythm game.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Commercial Success: It is one of the most successful VR games in history. As
                        of 2023, it has sold over 10 million copies across all platforms.</li>
                    <li>Platform Dominance: It was the first VR-only app to gross over $100
                        million in revenue on the Meta Quest platform alone.</li>
                    <li>Retention: It is a "go-to" app for VR users, driving high engagement through
                        official music packs (DLCs) from artists like Lady Gaga and Linkin Park.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="box" name="Conclusion">
                <h3 class="glitch">Half-Life VS BeatSaber</h3>
                <p>The "best" VR game depends on the goal. Half-Life: Alyx is the "best" narrative and
                    technical showcase, proving VR can host deep, complex stories. Beat Saber is the "best"
                    pure gameplay experience, a system-seller that is instantly understandable, infinitely
                    replayable, and a perfect ambassador for the technology.
