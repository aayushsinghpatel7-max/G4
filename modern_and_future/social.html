    <h1>The Social Dimension of Cloud Computing and Cross-Platform Connectivity</h1>

    <!-- ========================================= 
         Section 1
         Purpose: Describes how shared cloud systems create global player communities
         ========================================= -->
    <div class="box">
        <h3>Global Connection Through Shared Worlds</h3>
        <p>
            The merging of cloud computing and cross-platform gaming has completely reshaped how people connect through
            play. Gamers are no longer divided by consoles or devices - they're part of one massive, interconnected
            community. A player on mobile can join a friend on PC, share progress in real-time, and talk through
            integrated voice channels powered by cloud servers. This new level of accessibility has made gaming a social
            network of its own - alive 24/7, borderless, and ever-growing.

         Section 2
         Purpose: Highlights positive social impact and community building in gaming
         ========================================= -->
    <div class="box">
        <h3>Social Impact and Community Building</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud-based ecosystems encourage inclusivity, teamwork, and creative collaboration. Multiplayer games now
            act as digital meeting spaces where players form friendships, coordinate global tournaments, and even build
            digital identities. However, as gaming becomes more social and omnipresent, new patterns of behaviour appear
            - constant connectivity blurs the line between play and routine, transforming gaming from a hobby into a
            lifestyle.
        </p>

         Purpose: Addresses potential downsides and challenges of constant connectivity
         ========================================= -->
    <div class="box">
        <h3>The Other Side of Connectivity</h3>
        <p>
            While this evolution offers incredible opportunities, it also comes with challenges. Unlimited access and
            constant updates can lead to fatigue, social pressure, or even addictive patterns. Competitive ecosystems
            amplify stress and toxicity, while social ranking systems sometimes turn leisure into performance. The same
            networks that connect players can also isolate them if balance is lost - turning shared experiences into
            digital dependence.

         Section 4
         Purpose: Lists main risk areas related to social aspects of cloud-based gaming
         ========================================= -->
    <div class="box">
        <h3>New Risk Areas in Social Gaming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Addiction & Over-Engagement</i> &rarr; constant accessibility and cloud-based persistence make it
                easier to lose track of time; games are designed to keep players connected and rewarded continuously.
            </li>
            <li><i>Toxicity & Harassment</i> &rarr; aglobal matchmaking brings together players from different
                backgrounds, but anonymity can fuel hostility and cyber-bullying in competitive spaces.</li>
            <li><i>Social Pressure</i> &rarr; cross-platform progress systems often push players to "keep up" with
                friends or seasonal updates, creating a sense of obligation instead of relaxation.</li>
            <li><i>Privacy & Data Exposure</i> &rarr; shared cloud identities and linked accounts can expose sensitive
                user information or lead to targeted advertising based on gaming habits.</li>
            <li><i>Digital Fatigue & Mental Health</i> &rarr; the need to stay online, achieve ranks, or maintain social
                status in a game community can blur healthy boundaries between real and virtual life.</li>
        </ul>
