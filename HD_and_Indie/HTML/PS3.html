When the PlayStation 3 (PS3) was released in 2006, the company revealed a 20GB model priced at $499 and a premium version of 60GB for $599. This was nearly double the cost of the base Xbox360. This was because the PlayStation 3 had more advanced hardware components. Sony wanted the PS3 to be seen not just as a game console but as a powerful computer for the living room. However, the PS3 unique architecture proved to be difficult for developers to optimize. While capable of impressive performance when properly utilized, early PS3 games often failed to demonstrate the system's full potential. This contributed to a challenging launch period where multiplatform titles frequently performed better on the Xbox 360 despite the PS3's theoretically superior hardware. 

The PS3 had an integrated Blu-ray drive which had a large storage capacity and enabled playback of high-definition video up to 1080p resolution.

Technological Firsts
The PlayStation 3 achieved several industry firsts:
- First console with built-in HDMI port as standard
- First console capable of 1080p output
- First console with integrated Blu-ray technology
- First console with robust Linux support (later removed)
- First console with standard hard drive across all models
- Integrated PlayStation Network for online gaming (free, unlike Xbox Live)
These features positioned the PS3 as the most technologically advanced console of its generation, even if developers took years to fully harness its capabilities.

Challenging Launch Period
The PS3's launch in November 2006 faced multiple challenges:
High Price Point: At $499-$599, many consumers found the console prohibitively expensive, particularly compared to the Xbox 360's more affordable options.
Limited Launch Titles: The launch lineup included:
- Resistance: Fall of Man - Flagship exclusive shooter
- Genji: Days of the Blade - Action game with infamous "giant enemy crab" presentation
- Ridge Racer 7 - Racing game
- NBA Live 07 and Madden NFL 07 - Sports titles
- Multiplatform titles like Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and Full Auto 2
While respectable, this lineup didn't demonstrate clear advantages over Xbox 360's established library.

Developer Challenges: The Cell processor's complexity meant many early games failed to showcase the system's capabilities, leading to performance parity or disadvantage compared to Xbox 360 versions.
Supply Constraints: Manufacturing complexity and component costs limited Sony's ability to produce units rapidly, creating shortages without generating the positive scarcity buzz that Nintendo achieved with the Wii.
The Turnaround
Despite these challenges, the PS3's story became one of redemption:
- As developers mastered the Cell processor, exclusive titles like Uncharted, The Last of Us, and God of War III demonstrated the system's true capabilities
- The free PlayStation Network proved attractive compared to Xbox Live's subscription model
- Blu-ray's format war victory added significant value to the console
- Price reductions over time made the console more accessible
- The integrated Blu-ray player provided value beyond gaming
Long-Term Success
By the end of the seventh generation, the PS3 had largely recovered from its difficult launch, ultimately selling over 87 million units worldwide. While it never achieved the dominance of its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, it proved that technological ambition and long-term quality could overcome even the most challenging market entry.
The PS3 demonstrated that superior technology, given time and developer expertise, could eventually justify premium positioning. Its legacy influenced Sony's approach to future consoles, particularly the more accessible pricing and developer-friendly architecture of the PlayStation 4.
