        <p>
          When the PlayStation 3 (PS3) was released in 2006, the company revealed a 20GB 
          model priced at $499 and a premium version of 60GB for $599. This was nearly double 
          the cost of the base Xbox360. This was because the PlayStation 3 had more advanced 
          hardware components. Sony wanted the PS3 to be seen not just as a game console but as a powerful computer. 
          However, the PS3 unique architecture proved to be difficult for developers to optimize. 
          While capable of impressive performance when properly utilized, early PS3 games often failed to demonstrate 
          the system's full potential. This contributed to a challenging launch period where multiplatform titles 
          frequently performed better on the Xbox 360 despite the PS3's theoretically superior hardware.

        <h2> PS3 challenges </h2>     
        <div class="content">
        <ul>
          <li> High Price Point: At $499-$599, many consumers found the console expensive, 
            particularly compared to the Xbox 360's more affordable options. </li>
          <li> Limited Launch Titles that didn't demonstrate clear advantages over Xbox 360's established library. </li>
          <li> Developer Challenges: The Cell processor's complexity meant many early games failed to showcase the 
            system's capabilities, leading to same or worse performance compared to Xbox 360 versions. </li>
          <li> Supply Constraints: Manufacturing complexity and component costs limited Sony's ability to produce units rapidly</li>
