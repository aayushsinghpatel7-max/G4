        <p>
            The seventh generation did not just introduce better graphics;
            it fundamentally transformed the video game industry.
            The changes it brought established a new foundation for modern
            gaming that continues to this day.

                <h2>Lasting Industry Changes</h2>
                <h3>High-Fidelity Graphics as Standard</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the Xbox 360 and PS3, cinematic, high-definition
                    graphics became the expected standard for all major
                    AAA releases, closing the gap between game visuals
                    and blockbuster films.
                </p>
                <h3>The Centrality of Online Play</h3>
                <p>
                    Online functionality ceased to be an add-on and became
                    a core component. Digital distribution (like Xbox Live Arcade
                    and PlayStation Network), online multiplayer, friend lists,
                    and achievements became integral to the console experience.
                </p>
                <h3>The Rise of Indie Games</h3>
                <p>
                    Digital storefronts gave small, independent developers
                    a platform to sell their games directly to players.
                    This "indie revolution" introduced a wave of creativity,
                    innovation, and new genres that became a vital
                    part of the gaming ecosystem.
                </p>
                <h3>Market Fragmentation</h3>
                <p>
                    The market was no longer just a two- or three-console race.
                    The rise of powerful PC gaming via platforms like Steam
                    and the explosive, sudden dominance of mobile gaming
                    (smartphones and tablets) created a more fragmented,
                    diverse, and accessible industry than ever before.
