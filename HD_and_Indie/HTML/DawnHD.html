        <h2>The Consoles: Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii</h2>
        <p> 
          The main consoles of this era were Microsoft's Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 3, 
          and Nintendo's Wii. The Xbox 360 came out first in November 2005. 
          A year later, the PlayStation 3 was released on November 17, 2006, followed by 
          Nintendo's Wii on November 19, 2006. Each console brought its own innovations: the Xbox 360 
          focused on online connectivity, the PlayStation 3 offered powerful hardware and Blu-ray technology, 
          and the Wii introduced motion-based controls with broad appeal.

        <h2> Key innovations </h2>
        <h3>Digital Distribution & Online Networks</h3>
        <p>
          Digital distribution became popular, allowing users to download titles directly
          rather than relying on physical discs. Online networks grew quickly, enabling global 
          multiplayer gaming, downloadable content, and regular game updates.
        </p>
        <h3> Social Gaming Features </h3>
        <p>
          Social features such as achievements, leaderboards, and in-game communication allowed people
          to compare themselves to other players and build gaming communities. 
        </p>
        <h3> Cinematic Game Development </h3>
        <p>
          Game developers started creating more cinematic storytelling, realistic graphics, and open-world design, 
          which was possible thanks to more advanced hardware and improved game engines.
        </p>
        <h3> The Indie Revolution </h3>
        <p>
          This generation also saw the rise of indie games (independent games), which are made by small, 
          independent developers without big publisher control. These games often have simpler graphics but 
          offer innovative gameplay and stories, bringing original experiences that became an important part
          of modern gaming.
