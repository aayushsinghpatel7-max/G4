      <p>
        The 22 November 2005, Microsoft released the Xbox 360, which was the first console of the seventh generation. 
        The Xbox 360 gained an advantage over Sony because it was released one year before the PlayStation 3. 
        Therefore, Microsoft was in the lead because there were no competitors yet. 
        Microsoft released two models of the Xbox 360 at launch. 
        A Core system for 299$ and a Premium model for 399$. 
        Microsoft decided that making consoles not too expensive was an important 
        strategy for making gaming more accessible.
        The one year advantage gave the company time to establish market presence before competitors arrived. 
        Therefore, when Sony launched the PlayStation 3 in November 2006, 
        the Xbox 360 had already become the default choice for many gamers that wanted to 
        experience next-generation gaming.

            The Xbox 360 was launched with many different games for all types of players. Some popular games were:
            <li> Perfect Dark Zero : an exclusive shooting game </li>
            <li> Condemned: Criminal Origins : psychological horror game</li>
            <li> Call of Duty 2 : a high quality World War II shooter </li>
            <li> Need for Speed: Most Wanted : a famous car racing game</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This strong launch lineup, combined with rapid third-party support, 
            gave the Xbox 360 immediate software advantages that would persist throughout the generation.

        <h2 class="glitch" data-text="Red Ring of Death Crisis"> Red Ring of Death Crisis </h2>
        <p class="box">
          Despite its strong market position, the Xbox 360 faced an important hardware failure with their consoles, 
          which is known as the “Red Ring of Death” (RROD). The early models, especially those from the launch 
          period in 2006, suffered from a catastrophic hardware failures which was indicated by three red lights 
          illuminating around the console’s power button. The failure typically resulted from solder joint 
          failures between the processor and motherboard, often triggered by thermal stress as the console overheated 
          during extended gaming sessions. Warranty providers estimated that between 23.7% to 54.2% of early 
          Xbox 360 units experienced the RROD during their lifespan, making it one of the most pervasive hardware 
          failures in gaming console history. <br> </p>
        <p class="box">
          This crisis forced Microsoft to take action. They extended the console’s warranty to three years
          specifically for RROD failures and they implemented multiple hardware revisions. However, they absorbed 
          significant financial losses from repairs and replacements, and their reputation was damaged during 
          a critical market period. Despite these issues, Microsoft's strong software library, Xbox Live 
          infrastructure, and market timing allowed the console to weather the crisis and remain competitive 
          throughout the generation.
