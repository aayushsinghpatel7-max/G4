        <h2> Nintendo’s Blue Ocean Strategy </h2>
        <p>
          The Wii was launched in November 2006 at $250 which made it cheaper than the Xbox 
          and the PlayStation 3. This accessible pricing made next-generation gaming available 
          to consumers previously priced out of the market, dramatically expanding Nintendo's addressable audience.
          While Microsoft and Sony battled for dominance in high-definition gaming and technical supremacy, 
          Nintendo had a different strategy as they rejected competing on graphics, processing power, 
          or multimedia features. Instead, Nintendo wanted to make gaming different and more accessible. 
          This was known as “Nintendo’s Blue Ocean Strategy”. Nintendo recognized that pursuing technological 
          superiority in a crowded market would leave it outmatched by Sony and Microsoft's superior resources. 
          Therefore, the company decided to expand gaming itself. With this strategy, Nintendo would completely reinvent 
          gaming, and there would be no competitors.

        <h2> Motion-sensing controllers </h2>
        <p>
          With the release of Nintendo’s Wii, they invented motion-sensing controllers. 
          The Wii Remote used accelerometers and infrared sensors to detect motion, tilt, and 
          positional data, translating physical gestures into in-game actions with unprecedented 
          intuitiveness. For example, rather than pressing buttons to swing a tennis racket, players 
          physically swung the controller. Instead of using analog sticks to aim, players pointed at the screen. 
          The accessibility meant that experienced gamers and complete novices could enjoy the same games 
          with similar engagement. These accessories changed the controller buttons into simple objects people 
          instinctively understood. Before the Wii, video games were mostly for young men. However, Nintendo changed 
          that by making games intuitive, fun, and easy for anyone to play.

        <h2> Wii breaking records </h2>
        <p>
          Wii Sports was very popular because it was easy to understand and it was enjoyed regardless of prior 
          gaming experience. Wii Sports eventually exceeded 82 million copies worldwide, making it one of the 
          best-selling games of all time. <br>
          As the Wii became popular, the demand exceeded the supply, and even when Nintendo 
          increased manufacturing from 1.6 million units monthly to 2.4 million units monthly in 2008, 
          it was still struggling to meet demand. The Wii became the best-selling home console of its 
          generation and the third-best-selling home console in history at that time, outselling the PlayStation 3 
          and Xbox 360 combined in numerous regions during peak years. Nintendo demonstrated that creating games 
          and consoles that are accessible and fun for a broad audience, including families and casual gamers, 
          can generate extremely high sales, rivaling those of games that focus on complex and technically ambitious 
          features.
