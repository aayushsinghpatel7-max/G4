While Microsoft and Sony battled for dominance in high-definition gaming and technical supremacy, Nintendo had a different strategy as they rejected competing on graphics, processing power, or multimedia features. Instead, Nintendo wanted to make gaming different and more accessible. This was known as “Nintendo’s Blue Ocean Strategy”. Nintendo recognized that pursuing technological superiority in a crowded market would leave it outmatched by Sony and Microsoft's superior resources. Instead, the company would expand gaming itself. With this strategy, Nintendo would completely reinvent gaming, and there would be no competitors.

With the release of Nintendo’s Wii, they invented motion-sensing controllers. The Wii Remote used accelerometers and infrared sensors to detect motion, tilt, and positional data, translating physical gestures into in-game actions with unprecedented intuitiveness. For example, rather than pressing buttons to swing a tennis racket, players physically swung the controller. Instead of using analog sticks to aim, players pointed at the screen. The accessibility meant that experienced gamers and complete novices could enjoy the same games with similar engagement. This innovation liberated players from the complexity of traditional controllers and made gaming more accessible. These accessories transformed abstract controller inputs into tangible, familiar objects that users instinctively understood. Before the Wii, video gaming remained predominantly associated with young males. The Wii shattered this demographic limitation by making gaming physically active and intuitive rather than requiring specialized knowledge of complex controller schemes.

The Wii was launched in November 2006 at $250 which made it cheaper than the Xbox and the PlayStation 3. This accessible pricing made next-generation gaming available to consumers previously priced out of the market, dramatically expanding Nintendo's addressable audience.

Wii sports was very popular because it was easy to understand and it was enjoyed regardless of prior gaming experience.
Wii Sports eventually exceeded 82 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling games of all time.

The Wii became popular and therefore the demand exceeded the supply, and even when Nintendo increased manufacturing from 1.6 million units monthly to 2.4 million units monthly in 2008, it was still struggling to meet demand. The Wii became the best-selling home console of its generation and the third-best-selling home console in history at that time, outselling the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 combined in numerous regions during peak years. Nintendo demonstrated that creating games and consoles that are accessible and fun for a broad audience, including families and casual gamers, can generate extremely high sales, rivaling those of games that focus on complex and technically ambitious features.
