        <p>
            As development costs for high-definition AAA games skyrocketed,
            publishers began to rely on new revenue models. The traditional
            $60 price tag was no longer seen as sufficient to cover
            massive budgets and provide ongoing support.

                <h2>The Proliferation of New Models</h2>
                <h3>Downloadable Content (DLC)</h3>
                <p>
                    DLC evolved from simple cosmetic items into substantial
                    post-launch additions, such as new story chapters, map packs
                    for multiplayer, or new characters. This allowed companies to
                    extend the life and revenue stream of a successful game.
                </p>
                <h3>Microtransactions & Loot Boxes</h3>
                <p>
                    This model involves selling small virtual items, such as
                    character skins, in-game currency, or "loot boxes"
                    (randomized bundles of items). While often cosmetic,
                    this practice became highly controversial when items
                    offered gameplay advantages ("pay-to-win").
                </p>
                <h3>The Season Pass</h3>
                <p>
                    To bundle these new models, the "Season Pass" was introduced.
                    Players could pay an upfront fee to get access to all
                    planned DLC for a game, often at a slight discount. This
                    secured revenue for the publisher and guaranteed content
                    for the player.
