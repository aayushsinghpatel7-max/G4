        <p>
            After a challenging start with the PlayStation 3, Sony's launch of the
            PlayStation 4 in 2013 was a massive success. The company learned from
            its past mistakes and adopted a new, highly effective strategy
            that resonated perfectly with the gaming community.

                <h2>A Clear Message: "For the Players"</h2>
                <p>
                    Sony's entire marketing campaign was built around the simple slogan:
                    "For the Players." This message signaled a return to basics,
                    positioning the PS4 as a powerful, dedicated gaming machine
                    built for "core gamers."
                </p>
                <p>
                    It featured developer-friendly x86 architecture (similar to a PC),
                    which made development easier, and it focused on delivering
                    great games rather than all-in-one media features.

                <h2>Capitalizing on Competitor's Mistakes</h2>
                <p>
                    As Microsoft faced backlash for its Xbox One policies, Sony
                    took direct aim. At their E3 2013 press conference, they
                    famously announced that the PS4 would have no "always-on"
                    requirement and no restrictions on used games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This announcement, combined with a more powerful console
                    at a $100 lower price point (as it did not include a mandatory
                    camera), was seen as a decisive victory. This strategy
                    secured immense goodwill and established an early,
                    dominant market lead that defined the generation.
