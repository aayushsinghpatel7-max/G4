            Following the massive success of the Nintendo Wii's motion controls,
            both Microsoft and Sony sought to capture a similar broad audience.
            This led to the development of their own motion-based peripherals,
            each with a different technological approach.

                <h2>The Contenders: Kinect and PS Move</h2>
                <h3>Microsoft Kinect (Xbox 360)</h3>
                <p>
                    Launched in 2010, the Kinect was a highly ambitious, controller-free system.
                    It used a bar containing an RGB camera, depth sensors, and a multi-array microphone
                    to track the player's entire body. The marketing slogan, "You are the controller,"
                    promised a revolutionary new way to play, aimed primarily at family games,
                    dance, and fitness.
                </p>
                <h3>PlayStation Move (PlayStation 3)</h3>
                <p>
                    Also released in 2010, Sony's PlayStation Move was more an evolution of the Wii's
                    concept. It used a wand-like controller topped with a glowing sphere, which was
                    tracked by the PlayStation Eye camera. This setup offered greater precision
                    than the Wii and was marketed to both casual players and core gamers for
                    shooters and sports titles.

                <h2>Technology and Market Reception</h2>
                <p>
                    Despite strong initial sales—Kinect briefly held the record for the
                    fastest-selling consumer electronics device—both peripherals struggled.
                    Kinect suffered from input lag and a "core" game library that failed to
                    materialize, leaving it with mostly casual experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PlayStation Move, while technologically sound, was seen by many as a
                    "me-too" product and failed to build a library of must-have titles.
                    Ultimately, neither device replicated the cultural phenomenon of the Wii.
                    The Kinect was eventually unbundled from the Xbox One and discontinued,
                    while the Move controllers found a new, successful life years later
                    as the primary input for PlayStation VR.
