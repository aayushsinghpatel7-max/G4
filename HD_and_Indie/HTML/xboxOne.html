        <p>
            The launch of the Xbox One in 2013 marked a difficult start to the eighth
            generation for Microsoft. The company's vision was not for a simple game
            console, but an "all-in-one" entertainment hub for the living room,
            with heavy TV integration and a mandatory Kinect 2.0 sensor.

                <h2>Initial Policy Controversies</h2>
                <h3>"Always-On" Connectivity</h3>
                <p>
                    Microsoft initially announced that the console would require an
                    internet connection to function. It needed to perform a mandatory
                    online "check-in" at least once every 24 hours, even to play
                    single-player, disc-based games.
                </p>
                <h3>Digital Rights Management (DRM)</h3>
                <p>
                    Alongside the connectivity requirement, the console featured
                    strict Digital Rights Management (DRM) policies. These rules
                    heavily restricted the ability to sell, trade, or even lend
                    used physical games, in a push towards an all-digital future.

                <h2>The 180-Degree Reversal</h2>
                <p>
                    The backlash from the gaming community was immediate and overwhelming.
                    Players and press alike criticized the policies as anti-consumer.
                    In response to the intense criticism and Sony's effective counter-messaging,
                    Microsoft announced a complete reversal of these policies just
                    months before launch, removing the 24-hour check-in and all
                    used-game restrictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the damage was done. This, combined with a $100 higher
                    price point than its competitor (due to the mandatory Kinect),
                    cost Microsoft significant consumer goodwill and led to the
                    PlayStation 4 taking a commanding early lead in the console race.
