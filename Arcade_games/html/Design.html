            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Arcade games, born from hardware-limited, pay-per-play cabinets, forced designers to focus on immediate fun, clarity, and repeatability. These constraints produced durable design patterns seen across genres and generations.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>From the 1970s through the 1990s, arcades were a primary platform for interactive entertainment. Physical cabinets, joysticks and buttons, CRT displays, and coin mechanisms shaped what games could be and how players interacted with them.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="mechanics">
            <h2>Core Gameplay Innovations</h2>

            <h3>Short, Rewarding Loops</h3>
            <p>Arcade design favors compact gameplay loops: play → instant feedback → attempt again. This makes each session satisfying even when short.</p>

            <h3>Clear Goals & Immediate Feedback</h3>
            <p>Scoring, visual hits, and sound cues communicate success and failure instantly, guiding player learning without long tutorials.</p>

            <h3>Risk, Resource & Time Pressure</h3>
            <p>Lives, timers, and limited continues create tension and meaningful choices that encourage mastery and repeat plays.</p>

            <h3>Score & Social Comparison</h3>
            <p>High-scores and local leaderboards motivate competition and replay, fostering social engagement around short sessions.</p>

            <h3>Progressive Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Ramp-up difficulty and tight pacing keep players challenged while maximizing revenue in a coin-op context.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="aesthetics">
            <h2>Aesthetics &amp; Hardware Constraints</h2>
            <p>Limited processing power and displays produced distinct visual languages: bold sprites, readable UI, and exaggerated sound design. Constraints taught designers to prioritize clarity over detail.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="business">
            <h2>Business-Driven Design</h2>
            <p>The coin-op model directly influenced design decisions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attract mode and visual spectacle to pull players in from across the room.</li>
                <li>Balanced difficulty to encourage repeated coins without feeling exploitative.</li>
                <li>Short sessions to increase turnover and social spectating.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design Lessons for Modern Games</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritize clarity: make player intent and feedback obvious.</li>
                <li>Design short, satisfying loops that scale into longer play sessions.</li>
                <li>Use constrained systems to produce deep emergent gameplay.</li>
                <li>Consider social and competitive layers that extend longevity.</li>
                <li>Balance difficulty to reward skill while remaining fair.</li>
