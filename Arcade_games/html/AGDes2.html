    <h2>Attracting Players and Enhancing Gameplay</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Arcade games were made to stand out in busy, noisy arcades full of lights and sounds. 
        Their visuals and audio had two main goals: to attract players’ attention and to give 
        clear feedback during play. Every color, sound, and animation was designed to make the 
        game eye-catching and easy to understand.
    </p>

        <h2>Clarity and Contrast: Pixel Art and Simple Graphics</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Early arcade games had limited technology, so developers had to be creative. 
            They used pixel art—simple shapes and colors to create characters and objects. 
            Even with few pixels, designs like Pac-Man or Space Invaders became famous because 
            they were easy to recognize and memorable.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>Bright Colors and Clear Contrast</h2>
        <p class="content">
            In dark arcades, games needed to be bright and colorful to grab attention. 
            Designers used strong, primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and high contrast so 
            players could quickly see the main character, enemies, and power-ups. This made the 
            gameplay clear and helped players react fast, which was important for fast-paced action.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>Vector Graphics (A Different Look)</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Some games, like Asteroids and Battlezone, used vector graphics, which were made 
            from glowing lines instead of filled shapes. This gave them a sharp, wire-frame style 
            that made them stand out from other arcade machines and added variety to the arcade floor.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>Feedback and Attraction: Catchy Music and Sound Effects</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Sound was just as important as visuals. Each sound had a purpose—small “blip” sounds for 
            collecting items, explosions for destroying enemies, or short tunes for completing a level. 
            These sounds helped players understand what was happening in real time. The music was simple, 
            repetitive, and fast-paced, keeping the energy high. Games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders 
            used sound changes (like faster beats) to make the tension rise as the player advanced.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>The “Attract Mode”</h2>
        <p class="content">
            When no one was playing, arcade machines ran a short demo called “attract mode.” This 
            mode showed off the game’s graphics and played loud, distinctive sounds to catch the attention 
            of people walking by. The bright lights, colorful animations, and energetic music acted like 
            free advertising. If the game looked and sounded fun, more people would stop and play, 
            which meant more coins for the arcade.
