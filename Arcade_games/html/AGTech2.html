    <h2>From Simple Bleeps to Real Music and Detailed Graphics</h2>
    <p class="content">
        As arcade technology improved, so did the sound and graphics. Developers constantly 
        pushed the limits of what the machines could do, turning small hardware upgrades 
        into big jumps in how games looked and sounded. These changes not only made arcade 
        games more exciting but also influenced the entire video game industry.

        <h2>Early Sounds (Monophonic “Bleeps”)</h2>
        <p class="content">
            The first arcade games, like Pong and Space Invaders (1978), had very basic sound. 
            They could only make simple, one-note tones using basic sound chips. 
            These short “bleeps” and “buzzes” worked as feedback — for example, when a player 
            hit a target or lost a life — and helped give games a rhythm even without real music.

        <h2>FM Synthesis and Multi-Channel Music</h2>
        <p class="content">
            In the mid-1980s, new sound chips made by companies like Yamaha allowed for FM
            (Frequency Modulation) synthesis. This meant games could play multiple sounds at once 
            and produce tones that sounded more like real instruments. Games such as Out Run (1986) 
            featured full, energetic soundtracks that became a big part of the arcade’s appeal. 
            Players started remembering games as much for their music as for their gameplay.

        <h2>Sampled Sound and Voice Clips</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Some games began to use sampled audio — short, recorded sounds or voices. Games like 
            Rally-X (1980) and Pac-Man introduced recognizable sound bites and effects that gave 
            characters more personality. Later fighting games used grunts, laughs, and short phrases, 
            making the experience more realistic and lively.

        <h2>8-bit Graphics Era</h2>
        <p class="content">
            In the late 1970s and early 1980s, games used 8-bit graphics, meaning characters and objects 
            were made from small, blocky sprites with limited colors. Developers had to be creative — 
            using simple animations and clever designs to suggest movement and detail. Pac-Man’s opening 
            mouth or Donkey Kong’s jumping animations were simple but instantly recognizable.

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>16-bit Graphics Era</h2>
        <p class="content">
            By the mid to late 1980s, 16-bit processors allowed for much better visuals. Games could 
            display more colors, smoother animations, and larger, more detailed sprites. Titles like 
            Street Fighter II (1991) showed off bright backgrounds, complex animations, and expressive 
            characters, setting a new visual standard for arcade games.
