    <h2>The Cabinet, Controls, and the Social Dimension</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Playing in an arcade wasn’t just about the game on the screen — it was about the whole experience. 
        The cabinet design, controls, and social setting all worked together to make arcade gaming exciting, 
        interactive, and memorable.

        <h2>Ergonomics of Control: Joysticks and Buttons</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Most arcade machines had a joystick and a few large, colorful buttons. These controls 
            were strong and built to handle intense, competitive play. Players could feel every move 
            through the joystick’s clicks and button presses, giving a sense of power and control. 
            The simple, on/off nature of these controls made them perfect for quick, reaction-based 
            games like Street Fighter or Galaga.
        </p>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>Specialized Controls</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Some games needed special controllers to match their themes. Racing games like Pole 
            Position used steering wheels and pedals, while Centipede used a trackball for fast, 
            precise movement. Later, rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution introduced dance pads, 
            where players moved their whole bodies. These creative control systems made arcade games 
            more immersive and fun — something home consoles couldn’t fully copy at the time.

        <h2>Cabinet Artwork and Marquees: Artwork and Immersion</h2>
        <p class="content">
            The outside of the cabinet was just as important as the game itself. Bright, colorful 
            artwork covered the sides and front, showing off the game’s characters, theme, and energy. 
            The marquee — the lighted sign at the top — displayed the game’s title so players could spot 
            it from across the room. These visuals helped build excitement and made each machine feel 
            unique and alive.

        <h2>Durability and Design</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Arcade cabinets were made from strong wood and plastic so they could survive years of heavy use. 
            Their sturdy design also made them easy to move and repair, which was essential for busy arcades.

        <h2>The Social Aspect: Crowds and Spectators</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Arcades were social spaces. When someone was doing well in a game, a crowd would often 
            gather to watch. People would cheer, give advice, or react loudly when something exciting 
            happened. This made playing feel like a performance and added extra pressure and thrill 
            for the player.

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h2>Turn-Taking and Competition</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Players used a simple system to show who was next — they’d place a coin or token on the 
            machine’s edge. This small act created a friendly, face-to-face competition. Players 
            not only wanted to beat the game but also to beat each other’s scores right then and there. 
            The arcade became a place to meet people, compete, and share in the fun of gaming together.
