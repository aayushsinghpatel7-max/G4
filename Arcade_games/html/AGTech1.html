    <h2>Engineering the Arcade Experience</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Arcade machines were early examples of powerful, single-purpose computers. 
        They were built to be strong, reliable, and profitable. Every part of the cabinet — from 
        the controls to the screen — was designed to create an exciting experience for players and 
        to survive heavy use in public spaces.

        <h2>Cabinets: Durability and Visibility</h2>
        <p class="content">
            The arcade cabinet protected the game’s hardware and made it stand out in a 
            crowded arcade. Cabinets came in different shapes and styles:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li><strong>Upright Cabinets:</strong> Tall machines designed for standing play.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocktail Cabinets:</strong> Low, table-style with a flat screen under glass; screen could flip for a second player.</li>
            <li><strong>Deluxe or Environmental Cabinets:</strong> Larger, themed designs like car cockpits or flight simulators, giving a more immersive experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            Cabinets were made from strong wood and reinforced plastic to handle years of use 
            and occasional rough treatment.
        </p>

        <h2>Controls: Early Human-Computer Interaction</h2>
        <p class="content">
            The controls were the main way players interacted with arcade games. 
            They had to be simple, responsive, and tough enough for constant play.
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li><strong>Joysticks:</strong> 4-way or 8-way, with small switches giving a satisfying “click.”</li>
            <li><strong>Buttons:</strong> Large, colorful, on/off actions for fast reactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Trackballs and Spinners:</strong> Used in games like <em>Missile Command</em> or <em>Arkanoid</em> for precise movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Displays: CRT Technology</h2>
        <p class="content">
            The screen was one of the most important parts of the arcade machine.
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li><strong>CRT Monitors:</strong> Bright, glowing screens with sharp 
                contrast and instant reaction times, perfect for action games.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
            There were two main types of graphics:
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li><strong>Raster Graphics:</strong> Grid of colored pixels, used in <em>Pac-Man</em> and <em>Donkey Kong</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Vector Graphics:</strong> Lines drawn directly by the monitor’s electron beam; games like <em>Asteroids</em> had a sharp, wireframe look.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coin Mechanisms: The Business Behind the Game</h2>
        <p class="content">
            The coin mechanism controlled how players paid to start a game.
        </p>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>Used sensors to check coin size, weight, and material; if valid,
                added a credit to the PCB (the machine’s “brain”).</li>
            <li>The 1980s JAMMA standard allowed arcade owners to connect controls, screens, and 
                PCBs through a single connector, making it easy to swap games without buying a new machine.</li>
