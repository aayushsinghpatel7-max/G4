    <h2>Arcade Design for Short, Repeatable Play Sessions</h2>
    <p class="content">
        Classic arcade games were made for short but exciting play sessions. 
        Players paid for each game with a coin, so the design had to grab their 
        attention quickly and make them want to play again. Because of this, 
        arcade games were easy to start but hard to master. Players could enjoy 
        the game right away but needed skill and practice to reach high levels or scores. 
        This design kept people playing, improving, and spending more coins.

        <h2>Common Elements</h2>
        <h3>High Scores and Competition</h3>
        <p class="content">
            The high score table was one of the most important features in arcade games. 
            It turned a simple game into a social challenge. Players wanted to see their 
            initials on the leaderboard and beat their friends' scores. This friendly competition 
            motivated players to keep trying, improving their skills, and spending more time (and money) 
            on the machine.
        </p>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Time Limits and Lives</h3>
        <p class="content">
            Arcade games often limited how long you could play by using time limits or a set number
            of lives. When you lost all your lives, your game was over, and you had to pay again 
            to try once more. This system created tension and excitement, since players had to act 
            fast and focus to survive. Losing often felt like a small mistake that could be fixed 
            on the next try—another reason to keep playing.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Increasing Difficulty</h3>
        <p class="content">
            Arcade games were designed to get harder the longer you played. The first levels were 
            usually simple, helping new players learn the controls. As players improved, the game became 
            faster and more challenging, with tougher enemies or harder patterns. This gradual 
            difficulty curve rewarded skilled players and encouraged others to practice to get 
            further next time.
