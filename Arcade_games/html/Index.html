        <h2>The Rise of Arcade Games</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Early experiments and the first commercial machines (early 1970s)</h3>
            <p>
                The commercial arcade era began in the early 1970s with a handful of pioneering machines.
                One of the first commercially available coin-operated video games was released in 1971;
                it showed that interactive electronic entertainment could be a viable business outside of research labs.
                Atari's Pong (1972) quickly popularized the format: a simple, competitive table-tennis game installed in bars
                and arcades that proved the coin-op model could be hugely profitable.

            <h3>Innovation in gameplay and cabinets</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the 1970s designers experimented with controls, cabinet shapes, and audiovisual presentation.
                Developers used simple discrete logic and later microprocessor-based boards to implement new mechanics:
                more responsive controls, scorekeeping, and distinct sound effects. Breakout-style brick games and early racing
                and shooting concepts emerged as designers pushed for variety and replay value.

            <h3>Late-70s boom and cultural impact</h3>
            <p>
                By the late 1970s arcade machines became staples of malls, bars, and amusement centers. The success of several high-profile titles
                ignited a rapid expansion of the industry and a culture around high scores, tournaments, and arcade celebrity.
                Cabinets with artwork and marquee designs turned games into visible attractions; players gathered in social spaces around them.

            <h3>Technical legacy</h3>
            <p>
                The 1970s established many conventions still visible today: coin-operated monetization, specialized input devices
                (joysticks, paddles, trackballs), and an emphasis on short, addictive gameplay loops. These foundations enabled the
                later "golden age" of arcades in the early 1980s and influenced the design of home consoles and computer games.

        <p>
            From experimental prototypes to packed arcades, the 1970s were a formative decade that turned interactive electronics
            into a mass-market entertainment medium and set the stage for decades of innovation.
