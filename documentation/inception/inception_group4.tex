\section*{Git Repository Usage Guide}

\noindent
This section provides clear guidelines for all team members on how to correctly use the shared Git repository throughout the project.  
The goal is to maintain a well-organized, conflict-free workflow and ensure that everyone’s work integrates smoothly.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\subsection*{1. Initial Setup}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Clone the repository only once at the beginning of the project using:
    \begin{quote}
        \texttt{git clone <repository-url>}
    \end{quote}
    \item Make sure your local repository is linked to the main branch ({\large Development}) before starting any work.
    \item Always pull the latest updates before making any changes:
    \begin{quote}
        \texttt{git pull origin main}
    \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsection*{2. Folder and File Structure}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Do not rename or move shared folders (e.g., \texttt{css}, \texttt{images}, \texttt{html}) without group agreement.
    \item Place your HTML pages in your assigned topic folder only.
    \item Keep images optimized and appropriately named (e.g., \texttt{arcade\_pong.png}, \texttt{hd\_games.jpg}).

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsection*{3. Workflow and Commits}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Before you start working each day, always run:
    \begin{quote}
        \texttt{git pull origin main}
    \end{quote}
      to ensure you have the most recent version.
    \item Work on your assigned pages only. Do not modify others’ files unless you have explicit permission.
    \item After making your changes, add and commit them with clear, descriptive messages:
    \begin{quote}
        \texttt{git add .}\\
        \texttt{git commit -m "Added content to 3D games page"}
    \end{quote}
    \item Push your changes to the main branch:
    \begin{quote}
        \texttt{git push origin main}
    \end{quote}
    \item Keep commits small and frequent—avoid uploading many unrelated changes in one commit.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsection*{4. Collaboration Rules}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Communicate before making major structural changes.
    \item Only the CSS leaders are allowed to edit the CSS, any concern or suggestion should be communicated with them.
    \item If two people need to edit the same file, coordinate timing to avoid merge conflicts.
    \item Always respect the Git Leader’s instructions on branching, merging, or conflict resolution.
    \item Notify the team immediately if you encounter merge issues or deleted files.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsection*{5. What \textbf{NOT} To Do}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Do \textbf{not} push to main without pulling first.  
    \item Do \textbf{not} delete or rename folders used by others.  
    \item Do \textbf{not} upload large media files (videos, high-res images) without compression.  
    \item Do \textbf{not} commit with vague messages such as \texttt{"update"} or \texttt{"fix stuff"}.  
    \item Do \textbf{not} overwrite others’ work - always check what changed with \texttt{git status} or \texttt{git diff}.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsection*{6. Good Practices}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Always double-check your changes in the browser before committing.
    \item Keep the code readable, properly indented, and commented when necessary.
    \item Use consistent naming conventions for files and IDs/classes in HTML and adapt the naming to the CSS framework when needed.
    \item Regularly back up your local progress in a separate folder, just in case.
    \item Ask Aayush (or Niki or Kyle) if you are unsure about a command or merge situation.
    \item If you experience any issues with the Git repository, immediately contact Aayush, the Git Leader
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\subsection*{7. Git Command Reference}
\noindent
Below are the main Git commands everyone should know:
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\texttt{git clone <url>} & Clone the repository to your computer \\
\texttt{git pull origin main} & Download the latest updates from main branch \\
\texttt{git add .} & Stage all modified files for commit \\
\texttt{git commit -m "message"} & Save your changes locally with a message \\
\texttt{git push origin main} & Upload committed changes to GitHub \\
\texttt{git status} & Check which files have been changed \\
\texttt{git log} & View recent commit history \\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
Following these guidelines ensures a smooth workflow and prevents technical issues during the development of the \textit{History of Video Games} website.

\newpage

\subsection*{6. Accountability and Support}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2cm]
    \item Everyone is responsible for their assigned tasks.
    \item If you face issues (technical or scheduling), inform your Topic Leader early so adjustments can be made.
    \item Consistent inactivity or missed deadlines without communication will be addressed privately by the Group Leaders. If you have any problems, other things to do, etc and you cannot make something on time, communicate it as soon as possible so we can figure out a solution.
\end{itemize}
