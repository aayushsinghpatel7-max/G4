Github help


So Group 4, hope you had a good day. Now I made this document to help you guys push your code to the repository.  
Now remember, you are only allowed to push code to the folder that corresponds to your topic. For example, if your topic is arcade games, then only push code to the folder “Arcade_games”. 
Now once you happy with your changes, to push it, follow these commands. But before you push, ensure that you are in the “Development” branch (which you should be in by default but please ensure that you are ) and in your groups corresponding folder.
o	To push a new code to:
	git add  . ( yes the space and period at the end are needed) 
	git commit -m “*insert name for commit*” ( please name your commit, basically what your doing. Eg: if your adding a page about say PacMan your commit can be “PacMan info”)
	git push origin development

That all you need to upload your work to the repo. 

If your team has made a lot of changes to your folder and you would like the most up to date version please use the command: git pull

That’s all, if you still have any problems, please contact me on WhatsApp.
